<h3 class="p4 h3head">Foreword</h3>

<p class="p2">I hesitate to write of my experiences because so
many books have been written about the war, and
the story of the ambulancier has been told before.</p>

<p>Many young Americans in sympathy with the
Allied cause, and particularly the cause of France,
and many Americans anxious to uphold the honor
of their own country, when others were holding
back the flag, went over as “crusaders” in advance
of the American Army. Many had gone over before
I went; some have come back and told their
story and told it well&mdash;and so, although I went as
a “crusader,” I am not the first to tell the story.</p>

<p>But if my story interests a few of my friends and
kin I shall be satisfied with the telling of it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head">Introduction</h3>

<p class="p2">A citation in general orders, by the Commanding
General of the 69th Division of Infantry of the
French Army, which declares that Driver Philip S.
Rice “has always set an example of the greatest
courage and devotion in the most trying circumstances
during the evacuation of wounded in the
attacks of August and September, 1917, before
Verdun,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
ought to be sufficient introduction in
itself to this story of an American Ambulance
Driver who bore himself valiantly in those days of
the great tragedy at Verdun. And yet for the
story itself, and for the man who has written it,
something can be said by one of his friends in appreciation
of both the story and the man.</p>

<p>The literature that is coming out, and which will
come out, of the great war, will never cease as long
as history shall recite the efforts of the German
Spoiler to gain the mastery of the world, and fill
the world with hate and hunger. Therefore, every
bit of evidence that shall touch even so lightly on
every phase of the conditions, and reveal even in the
slightest sense a picture of what happened, will
have its value.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Rice, I can say that as a youngster the
spirit of adventure was strong in him. He tried
his best to break into the War with Spain in 1898,
but his weight and heart action compelled his rejection
by the surgeons. He later, however, served
with credit under my command, as an enlisted man,
and as an officer of the Ninth Infantry, National
Guard of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>When the United States entered the conflict on
the side of the Entente Allies in the present war,
Mr. Rice, knowing that he could not gain a place in
the fighting forces, volunteered for service in the
American Ambulance Corps in France. Herein
is written the story of that service simply told, without
vainglory or boasting. It is a story of a soldier’s
work&mdash;for it was as a soldier he served.</p>

<p>Simply told, yes; but well told. For instance, the
recital of the story of that evening of July 13, in
the after dusk, when the guns had silenced forever
the voice of his comrade, Frederick Norton, when
they laid him to rest on the side of the hill in view
of the enemy, and the towers of the desecrated
Cathedral of Rheims. And that other time, when
in front of Verdun, the “slaughter house of the
world,” when nerve-racked he had stopped his car
on the road, in the midst of the shells and gas clouds,
when he said to himself: “If I do go and am hit, the
agony will be over in a few minutes, but, if I turn
back, the agony will be with me all the rest of my
life”&mdash;so he put on his gas mask and drove on.</p>

<p>The “Cross of War” is not given by France for
any but deserving action. The men of France who
commended and recommended Phil Rice for the
distinguished honor conferred upon him knew that
in every day of his service he deserved what the
French Government, through General Monroe,
Commanding the 69th Division of Infantry, gave
to him&mdash;the Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>It is something to have been a part of it, to have
visioned with your own eyes the scenes and the
places that now lie waste upon the bosom of fair
France; to have witnessed the horrors of the deadly
gigantic monster War as it is now being conducted
“Over There.” To have heard singing in your ears
the whirr of the avions in the night air&mdash;to have seen
with your own eyes the tragic diorama of the hateful
and cruel side of war&mdash;and it is something for
your children’s children in the years that are yet
to come to tell that in the Great War their forebear
bore an honorable part.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">An American Crusader at Verdun</h3>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="One">I</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">The Voyage</h4>

<p class="p2">It was a glorious afternoon in Spring, to be exact,
May 19, 1917, at about three bells, that the
French liner <span class="title">Chicago</span> moved out of her dock and
started down the North river on the voyage to
France, crowded for the most part with volunteers,
entering various branches of service in the World
War. There were doctors, camion drivers, aviators,
ambulanciers&mdash;also a few civilians, half a
dozen members of the Comédie Française returning
to their native land and stage; and more than likely
there were one or two spies. It was the largest
crowd of “Crusaders” that had embarked for
France since the war began.</p>

<p>The deck was crowded, too, with relatives and
friends of those who were sailing; there was waving
of flags, cheering and shedding of tears, and it was
my observation that those who were being left behind
took the departure harder than those who were
leaving. But I suppose that is true when one starts
on any long journey and I suppose it is especially
true when one starts on the last long journey to a
better world.</p>

<p>Those of us on the boat were not bound for a
better world, we were just bound by going to help
make the world a little better if we could. But
some whom I met on the voyage have since passed
on to a better world.</p>

<p>I am sure that most of the men on board were
imbued with a spirit of seriousness. I was serious
about the journey myself. Practically since the war
began, I had been moved with a desire to get into it.
I resented the invasion of Belgium, as have all red-blooded
people, no matter what their nationality. I
resented the murder of Edith Cavell; I resented
the sinking of the Lusitania; I resented the atrocities
committed, not against the people of any race
in particular, but against fellow human beings; I
resented the loud clamorings of white-blooded pacifists
and Prussian propagandists who would have
kept us out of war at any price, even at the price
of honor. When I finally reached the decision to
take a small part in the war and acted upon that
decision by enlisting as a volunteer ambulance driver,
I felt touched with a spirit of rest.</p>

<p>I did not know a single soul aboard when the
liner cast off and backed out into the river. I knew
quite a few before we reached Bordeaux. Shipboard
is the easiest place in the world to make acquaintances,
and being alone I drifted about, perhaps,
more than if I had gone on board with a
crowd of my own friends.</p>

<p>That morning in the Waldorf I had been told
by Fred Parrish that a young fellow by the name
of Meeker was going over for aviation and I had
been told to look him up. A little later that same
morning, while walking down Fifth avenue, bound
for a bookstore to purchase a French dictionary and
a volume of Bernard Shaw’s plays (I already had
a Testament), I ran into my literary friend, Mr.
George Henry Payne. It seemed perfectly natural
to run into George on Fifth avenue&mdash;he seemed
perfectly at home there. George is cosmopolitan&mdash;he
is at home anywhere. He had sometimes been
in my “Little Red House on the Hill,” my summer
home in Dallas, Pennsylvania. “Darkest Dallas,”
George called it.</p>

<p>This meeting with George on Fifth avenue has a
bearing on my trip across. He informed me that
a friend of his, a Miss Katherine G&mdash;&mdash;, was sailing
on the same boat. George told me to introduce myself
to her and said he would communicate with her
and vouch for the meeting. There was no time for
a full description. George merely informed me that
she was charming, though intellectual&mdash;that she had
translated the works of Brandes into English and
done a lot of heavy stuff like that. I confess I was
a little terrified at the prospect of meeting Miss
Katherine G&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The boat was soon headed down the river and the
crowd of friends and relatives on the dock faded
from view, still waving farewell. Before we passed
the Statue of Liberty I ran into Meeker&mdash;a fine,
wholesome looking young chap&mdash;dressed in a light
spring suit&mdash;a flower in his buttonhole. I saw a lot
of Meeker before we reached the other side. He
had spirit, and speaking of going as a “Crusader,”
he remarked: “I would rather be a ‘went’ than a
’sent.’” At dinner I met a number of other fellows,
among them a young aviator just out of Princeton.
His name was Walcott.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>I only kept a diary for a few days. I found that
everyone was keeping a diary. One day on deck I
heard a man reading a page of his to an acquaintance
and I heard him remark with a show of pride
that the other fellows in his stateroom were keeping
their diaries by copying from his. I heard him
read: “Arose at seven o’clock, took a bath at seven-fifteen;
had breakfast at eight, on deck at eight-thirty,
sea is choppy.” And I thought to myself as
I moved about the deck: “What an inspiring document
to leave to one’s descendants.” So after
about four pages of the brief one that I kept I
find the following:</p>

<p>“I wonder what the intellectual Miss G&mdash;&mdash; looks
like&mdash;whether she is prematurely old, anaemic or
possibly has a tuft of hair on her chin. I have
never read Brandes but he sounds heavy. I called
on Miss G&mdash;&mdash; last evening after dinner. Ports
were masked&mdash;curtains drawn, the decks were black
except for spots of fire indicating a cigarette here
and there. But in the darkness there was singing,
and it was good, too. The submarines have not
ears&mdash;only one eye like the witches in ‘Macbeth.’ I
decided to call on Miss G&mdash;&mdash; and I approached her
stateroom thinking of Brandes, of high-brow feminine
youth prematurely blighted, of a tuft of hair
and anaemia. The stateroom door was open and
there were lights. The room was littered with roses
and clothes and things. There was a feminine,
human touch to that stateroom, but Miss G&mdash;&mdash;
was not within. Perhaps she was on the deck somewhere
among those cigarettes glowing like fireflies
in the dark. I hastily tossed my card upon her pillow
and returned to the deck. Miss G&mdash;&mdash; has not
returned my call&mdash;I have not seen her to my
knowledge.”</p>

<p>Later that first evening on board I went up into
the smoking room and a cloud of blue smoke hung
low over the occupants who crowded the room.
They did not look like members of a peace commission&mdash;some
were dressed in khaki, some wore yellow
driving coats, one wore the uniform of the
American Ambulance. Over at a corner table three
French officers, in their light blue uniforms, were
seated with ladies who I afterward learned were
their wives. One of the officers wore the Croix de
Guerre, which filled me with admiration and envy.
At another table was a young French girl surrounded
by admiring men. She was vivacious,
possessed of a high color and beautiful teeth&mdash;even
if she did smoke cigarettes. Her friends called her
“Andree.” At another table a lively card game
was going on&mdash;later I got to know the participants&mdash;Harris,
Lambert, Bixby, Branch, Foltz and
others.</p>

<p>Down in the music room it was crowded, too.
Some one was playing the piano, and playing well.
Altogether it was a likely looking crowd that I
found on the boat.</p>

<p>Among my early acquaintances was a promising
young poet who I was told had already begun to
fulfil his promise. He was just out of Harvard and
lived at South Orange, New Jersey. We discovered
that we had some things in common&mdash;we both
liked cigarettes and disliked white-corpuscled pacifists.
We were photographed together by a friend.
I have always been willing to have my photograph
taken with a successful poet, providing he wore
good clothes and did not wear long hair. I was glad
to be photographed with Bob Hillyer. He wore a
blue serge suit, a light blue necktie and had rather
sad eyes, though I thought he was too young to
have suffered much. The well-to-do never suffer
much at Harvard. He had a slight cold and I prescribed
for him out of a medicine chest which had
been presented to me before sailing. The next day
he told me he felt much better. I did not tell him
that I discovered too late that I had given him the
wrong medicine.</p>

<p>I met another young fellow who was not a poet.
He introduced himself to me and said he had met
me before somewhere. I could not recall the incident,
though his name was familiar. On better acquaintance
I got to call him “Bridgey” for short.
He suggested that we take a walk around the deck,
which was in darkness except for the cigarettes
glowing here and there. “Bridgey” fell over a coil
of rope before we had covered the starboard side,
after which he inquired the number of his stateroom
and retired for the night. The next morning he
came to me and confided that he was rooming in a
cabin with a begoggled person of strong religious
propensities who had taken him to task for his levity
of the night before. I inquired what form his levity
had taken, and he confessed “I tried to feed grapes
to him when he wanted to go to sleep and then accidentally
smashed an electric light globe while
taking off my shoe.” I tried to comfort him with
the thought that religion was not merely a matter
of goggles.</p>

<p>There were two fellows on the boat whom I was
destined to know intimately later on after reaching
the front. They were from Providence, Rhode
Island. One was tall and slender and had red hair.
His name I learned was Harwood B. Day. He
will always be known affectionately to me as “Red”
Day. The other was tall and slender and had dishevelled
hair from constant reading. His name I
learned was Frank Farnham. To me he will always
be just “Farney.” Day was returning to the service
after a visit in the States.</p>

<p>On a later page in my brief diary, from which I
have already quoted, I find the following:</p>

<p>“Sapristi! I have just met Miss Katherine
G&mdash;&mdash;. She may be intellectual but she certainly
is charming. She may have translated Brandes
into English and done other heavy stuff like that,
but she is not prematurely old. She is not anaemic
and there is not a tuft of hair on her chin. She is
young, she has black hair and black eyes and a kindly
smile like a practical Christian. She is feminine.
Her stateroom told the story&mdash;littered with flowers,
clothes and things. If the boat is hit I shall certainly
be one of several who will offer her a life
belt.” There my diary ended.</p>

<p>The voyage was calm enough and without many
exciting incidents. One of the passengers died. He
was very old and feeble when he came on board,
bound for his home I believe, in Greece. He was
buried at sea early one morning before those who
had gone to bed had risen.</p>

<p>Many passengers slept on deck while passing
through the war zone. The ship’s concert took place
a couple of nights before we landed. Many passengers
stayed on deck during the ship’s concert. Miss
G&mdash;&mdash; and the two aviators, Meeker and Walker,
took part in a one-act play. I wrote the play originally
but Miss G&mdash;&mdash; rewrote it because she said
it was too “high-brow,” which convinced me that
she was wonderfully human though highly intellectual.</p>

<p>Reaching France, we “crusaders” who had become
intimate on the long voyage, which was all too
short, went our various ways&mdash;some to aviation
fields&mdash;some to camion camps&mdash;some to the American
Field Headquarters at 21 Rue Reynouard,
Paris, France. Some I have seen since&mdash;some I
will never see again.</p>

<p>Coming out of an Eleventh Century Cathedral
in Bordeaux with a couple of friends, I saw “Andree”
pass by in an open carriage. She was smiling
happily, showing her white teeth when she
turned and waved to us as the carriage disappeared
around the corner.</p>

<p>I last saw Meeker and Walcott in front of the
Café de la Paix in Paris. I wished them luck in
their undertakings for the cause. Meeker and
Walcott, aviators, have since fallen on the field and
I am sure the world is bound to be just a little better
for the inspiring sacrifice they have made.</p>

<p>In Paris I met Frederick Norton, of Goshen,
New York.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">“Over There” at Last!</h4>

<p class="p2">Friday, the twenty-second day of June, I arose
upon a birthday anniversary. I had no intention
of observing it, but I felt in a vaguely definite way
that something interesting was to happen before
the day was over; and this feeling was not long in
growing from the vague to the definite.</p>

<p>From the time of reaching Paris I was busily
engaged in various ways at the headquarters of the
American Field Service while impatiently waiting
my turn to go to the front. I was more than impatient&mdash;at
times I was fretful. I even believe
that upon cross-examination the heads of the service
would admit that I was absolutely annoying.
I supposed that I would be assigned to a new ambulance
section soon to be organized, but on this day
I have mentioned, I was informed that I was to
fill a vacancy in Section Number One, the oldest
American Field Section serving with the French
army. I was in luck. Section One had been at the
Battle of the Marne, it had served in Belgium&mdash;it
had been at Verdun in 1916 and had gained a glorious
record for itself at various places along the
Western Front. I was to be prepared to leave
Paris on Sunday morning, and to my delight I
learned that Frederick Norton was also to join
the same Section.</p>

<p>While working together in the Paris headquarters
we discovered that we had many mutual friends
and this naturally put us on a friendly footing from
the beginning. We found that our ideas coincided
about many things and about people. I thought
Norton had some pretty good ideas and was an excellent
judge of people. Sometimes when we were
talking together he would say about someone:
“How do you size him up?” And I would tell him.
Usually our ideas coincided. Norton had been a
traveller&mdash;he had been to Alaska&mdash;he had been
North with Peary&mdash;he had been to Japan&mdash;he already
knew something of France&mdash;he had been a
hunter&mdash;he had a pilot’s license to drive an aeroplane&mdash;he
had done some toboganning and skiing in
Switzerland, which are not sports for the timid.
These things I learned from him slowly, for he was
extremely modest and not given to talking about
his exploits. I was glad when I found that we were
to start for the battle front together, and he was
kind enough to say that he was glad, too.</p>

<p>Saturday night and a short “Good-night” to
Paris. A short “Good-night” because cafés close
at nine o’clock, and besides I must be up early the
following morning. In company with my delightful
pagan friend “Bridgey,” I went around to a
little quiet out of the way café, which was hardly
known to Americans. The little café was kept by
an elderly lady whose husband had been killed in
the war and by her daughter whose husband had
also been killed in the war. This mother and daughter
were excellent cooks, but their place was plain
and comfortable. There was sawdust on the floor.
Sitting in the little back dining room we could see
into the kitchen and watch the meal being prepared.
Across the street in the “Chinese Umbrella” there
was more ostentation, style and atmosphere. The
“Chinese Umbrella” was patronized mostly by
Americans and the atmosphere was not Parisian.</p>

<p>“Bridgey” had invited me there for a quiet, exclusive
farewell supper, and as we sat in the back
room of the café he regaled me with an account of
how he had tried for aviation the day before. He
was nearsighted and wore spectacles, without which
he could scarcely see across the room. From a
friend he had procured a copy of the alphabet eye
test and had tried to commit it to memory; he reported
for examination with spectacles in his
pocket. He missed on the third letter, and being
brusquely informed that he had failed, “Bridgey,”
who certainly had a sense of humor, smilingly adjusted
his spectacles and bade adieu to the inspecting
officer.</p>

<p>Supper finished, I said “Au ’voir” to Madame
and her daughter, the two war widows, and then
went off to bed.</p>

<p>“Bridgey” was on hand next morning to see us
start for the front. A few other acquaintances
were at the station, too. I have not seen “Bridgey”
since but I heard that he was at Verdun during the
big offensive.</p>

<p>Norton and I boarded the twelve o’clock train
bound for the front. The train was crowded with
French officers, grey haired Generals, Colonels, officers
of all ranks and of various branches of the
service. There were very few civilians and not half
a dozen women. Twelve o’clock, and Paris faded
behind us as we started for the battle front.</p>

<div class="chapter"><a name="Chap_3" id="Chap_3"></a>
<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">In the Champagne Region</h4>

<p class="p2">We left the train at Epernay, an important city
some twenty miles back from the battle lines, but
subject to air raids, as I observed from demolished
and dilapidated buildings in various parts of the
town, and as I was to learn from personal experience
before many days had passed.</p>

<p>Here we were met by a member of Section One, a
young fellow by the name of Stout, well named, of
stocky build and robust appetite. Norton and I
had eaten lightly and suggested that we repair to a
café for luncheon before proceeding on to where
Section One had its cantonment near the front.
Stout said he would join us for company’s sake,
but that he had finished dinner just a short while
before. As we ate and talked a large plate of pastry
was placed upon the table and Stout was prevailed
upon to take one, and as we talked Stout
emptied the plate and we called for more which we
divided with Stout. After luncheon I caught Norton’s
ear and said to him: “You heard Stout say
he had his Sunday dinner?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You noticed the vanishing plate of sweets?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks to me,” I said, “as if Section One
is starving.”</p>

<p>That was before we knew Stout of robust appetite.
But Stout had plenty of vim and vigor and
was untiring, and later won the Croix de Guerre
at Verdun. Stout and I quarrelled at Verdun, after
which I had a genuine affection for him.</p>

<p>We clambered into a motor truck, Stout driving,
and were on the second stage of our journey to the
front. We reached the town of Louvois about six
o’clock. Here Section One had its cantonment.
Louvois is a picturesque village, far enough back
from the lines not to be entirely deserted by its
civilian population, mostly simple people living in
simple homes just as their forebears had lived in
the same homes a hundred years and more before.
Here we began to breathe the atmosphere of the
war&mdash;here, night and day, we saw the movement of
the troops to and from the front&mdash;we saw the procession
of camions carrying munitions and supplies&mdash;large
cannons being drawn by many horses&mdash;the
little machine guns&mdash;sometimes a fleet of armored
cars equipped with anti-aircraft guns. Overhead
we saw the large observation balloons and heard the
whirr of aeroplanes. In the distance we could hear
the firing at the front.</p>

<p>Supper was being served underneath a shed, and
it was a good supper, too. Section One was not
starving. We were cordially received by the members
of the Section. “Red” Day and “Farney”
were in the gathering. “Red” had served with the
Section in Belgium. After supper we strolled
along the street and listened while Purdy, a bright
young fellow, told us all about the war. Purdy
was six feet tall and as I later observed every inch
a soldier.</p>

<p>That night we were billeted in the second story
of a dilapidated barnlike building from which the
windows were all gone, and lying on my cot I could
see the stars through the roof. That night a rat
ran across my face. At last I was getting into
the war.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Qualifying as a Driver</h4>

<p class="p2">The following morning Norton and I, not having
been assigned to cars, were set to work changing
a tire. Down on our hands and knees we began to
struggle&mdash;a few of the men were standing about.
Norton laughed softly and whispered to me:</p>

<p>“Have you ever changed a tire before?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said; “have you?”</p>

<p>“No,” chuckled Norton, but we quickly finished
the job and felt very proud of our first effort.</p>

<p>A little later I was taken out for a trial ride to
prove whether or not I could really drive a Ford
car. William Pearl, our volunteer mechanician,
went with me on the run. Pearl had been a Rhodes
scholar and had joined the Section some time before.
A couple of months after that trial drive he
and I were destined to have a thrilling and trying
experience, in which he was the principal actor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 width="493" height="267"
 alt="Illustration: Cars Waiting for a Run"
 />
 <p class="caption">Cars Waiting for a Run</p>
</div>

<p>The trial ride took us along a road for about
seven miles, where we came to the brow of a hill.
Here we stopped the car and walked out into an
open field and there I obtained my first glimpse of
the war, spread out before us in a panorama. In

the distance, to the left, I could see the city of
Rheims, the towers of its desecrated cathedral looming
up distinctly. I could see the shells falling and
bursting in the city. Pearl informed me, as we stood
there, that an average of two thousand shells a
day were being dropped on the city. In front of
us I could see the hills laid barren by shell fire and
scarred by the lines of trenches. Overhead a German
aeroplane had crossed the French lines&mdash;the
anti-aircraft guns had opened fire&mdash;little puffs of
cloudlike smoke appeared in the sky underneath the
plane as it rose to higher altitudes. French planes
arose in pursuit and finally the German plane disappeared
from sight over its own lines. Directly
overhead a bird was singing in a tree just as cheerfully
as if there was no such thing as trouble in the
world. Looking back in the opposite direction I
could see women and young girls working in the
vineyards.</p>

<p>As we started to leave the spot Pearl pointed to
a town nearby on our left.</p>

<p>“That is the town of Ludes,” he said. “Notice
where it is, because you will have to go there when
on duty.”</p>

<p>I looked in the direction that he pointed, little
realizing that the town of Ludes would be forever
associated in my mind with the most tragic incident
of my service in France.</p>

<p>Then we turned and drove back to Louvois.
That was the full extent of my training for front
line work. I was informed that I had qualified as
an ambulance driver.</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Five">V</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">“Car <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 13”</h4>

<p class="p2">Having been duly declared a qualified driver, I
was assigned to a car which happened to be number
13, but as I am not particularly superstitious this
did not make me nervous.</p>

<p>Then I was sent to post for duty out at the town
of Ludes. Here we had our headquarters in a little
Swiss chalet hidden behind a clump of trees; though
within sight and sound of the war, it was peaceful
enough, at least for those on war duty. Everything
is comparative. Before many days had passed I
was to see that peaceful little chalet stained with
blood. The place was equipped with a telephone
bell, which would signal when a car was needed at
a front line post. Those on duty here answered the
calls in rotation.</p>

<p>About noon of my first day on duty a call came
in for two cars. One of the cars was to carry
wounded men back to the town of Epernay, the
other car was to go to the extreme front line post.
One of the calls was for Joe Patterson of Pittsburgh,
the other call was for me. Out of politeness
to a new man “Pat” gave me the choice of runs.</p>

<p>It seemed to be much easier to get right into the
serious work than to have the suspense of waiting,
so I chose the run to the front line post. I started
off over the hills, through the ancient town of Verzeney,
famous for its wines&mdash;through the winding
streets, turning sharply at a corner&mdash;down a long
steep hill hidden from view of the enemy by camouflage&mdash;past
what was known as the Esperance farm
till finally I reached the post. Here I stopped my
car and waited. Here there was a canal, the waters
of which had been let out, and into the canal banks
had been built little dug-outs. In the one where I
was to wait and sleep until needed were two rough
cots, a shelf on which there were some rather dirty
eating utensils and a loaf of dry bread.</p>

<p>During the afternoon there was intermittent firing
but no great activity on either side of the lines.
Occasionally an aeroplane would fly overhead.
Once during the afternoon a German plane flew
over in an effort to attack an observation balloon,
but was successfully driven off by the French.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed quickly enough without
having my services called for and at supper time
I had my first meal of trench fare with French
poilus for company, a cup of hot soup, a chunk of
meat, a slice of bread and a cup of coffee. The cook
who served us was a big fellow with a black beard.
He was killed a short time after and his body lay
all day in a nearby dug-out.</p>

<p>After supper I clambered over the canal bank
and walked along the empty canal bed observing
the marks of German shells. Then there was a sudden
volley of shots from a French battery near at
hand, the guns of which were so carefully concealed
that I had not observed it. I quickly clambered
back over the “safe” side of the canal bank and
waited.</p>

<p>I began to feel restless and to wonder when I
would be called to get out into the battle of the
night.</p>

<p>In the meantime the firing had increased on both
sides of the lines.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Six">VI</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">The “Crusader”</h4>

<p class="p2">It was some time after nine o’clock and growing
dark when a French soldier came up and handed
me a slip of paper bearing a message which had
just come over the telephone. The message conveyed
instructions for me to drive down the road
a couple of miles to a front line dressing station,
where I would find wounded who had just been
carried in. I was informed that the call was urgent.
Though I am not fearless by any means, I
did not feel frightened as I walked out to my car
and started the engine; but I noticed that my heart
was beating rapidly.</p>

<p>A few French soldiers waved to me and called
“Au ’voir” as I got in the seat and was off down
the road, first to the left, then to the right, then
straight ahead as fast as I dared drive. The road
took me directly in front of the French batteries,
and in the growing darkness the flashes of fire from
the guns and the concussion in my face made it
seem as if they were firing directly at me, not over
me. I drove on till I reached the post to which I
had been sent, then backed up my ambulance around
near the entrance to the dug-out and stopped. An
officer stepped up and shook hands with me and in
English said: “The American drives fast.”</p>

<p>He explained to me that the wounded were being
cared for and would soon be ready for the journey.
A small group of silent stretcher bearers were
standing near the entrance to the dug-out. The
firing increased in intensity&mdash;the battle of the night
was on. The officer remarked to me: “The Germans
are very angry.” I handed the officer a cigarette
and lighted one myself. I have found that
tobacco is a great solace to the nerves when under
fire. We continued our broken conversation. “Do
you come from New York?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Near New York,” I replied. Every place east
of Chicago is near New York when you are over
three thousand miles away.</p>

<p>“Do you like champagne?” he inquired. It was
not an invitation, he was merely getting my point
of view. We were standing within a few miles of
the richest champagne producing vineyards in the
world. Then I looked in the direction of the dug-out,
into the dimly lighted entrance, and I saw
stretcher bearers slowly coming out bearing a
wounded soldier and I braced myself for the first
shock of the horrors of war. Gently the wounded
soldier was lifted into my ambulance, then two more
wounded were carried out. I closed and fastened
the back curtain of the car, started the engine and
climbed into the seat. “Drive gently,” said the officer,
shaking hands with me. “Thank you, good-night,”
and I started on the return trip, in the dark
without lights.</p>

<p>As I drove back to the town of Ludes, troops
were moving to the front under the cover of darkness
and I was obliged to blow my whistle continually.
Now and then a large camion would loom up
suddenly in the darkness directly in front of me&mdash;a
little blacker than the darkness itself&mdash;that is how
I could see it. I would turn quickly to avoid being
hit. We always drove without lights at the front.
Half way up the long hill leading to the town of
Verzenay the water was boiling in the radiator and
the engine was hitting on three cylinders&mdash;I wondered
if I would make the heavy grade; I wondered
if a bursting shell would sweep the road; I wondered
if I would get the wounded safely back; I
wondered about many things in those moments on
my first night drive in the dark. On through the
dark winding narrow streets of the town of Verzeney,
at one place driving with difficulty through a
flock of sheep, on in safety to the town of Ludes
to the building which served as a field hospital. I
felt a great sense of relief when I drew up at the
entrance safely back with my wounded.</p>

<p>Then I drove back to the little Swiss chalet to
await my next call. Before turning in for a little
sleep I stood in the entrance listening to the continual
firing along the front and watching the signal
rockets, the star shells, and the flashes of the guns.
Then I went inside, climbed over a sleeping companion,
found a vacant space on the floor, rolled up
in my blanket, put my coat under my head and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>I had not been sleeping long when the telephone
bell rang. It was my turn out again. This time I
received instructions to drive over into another direction
to a château which served as the headquarters
of a French General. Château Romont it was
called. There I was to await further instructions.
So I parked my car in the courtyard and was led
down into the dark cellar of the château. As I
entered I could hear heavy breathing&mdash;evidently
some one was sleeping there. A light was made and
I was shown a rough cot where I might sleep until
needed. Again I curled up in my blanket and was
quickly asleep. I had only been asleep for a few
minutes when some one touched me on the shoulder
and awakened me. This time I was to drive over to
the shell wrecked town of Sillery. It was then
about four in the morning, the dawn was grey and
then a streak of red in the east over the line of
German trenches. The firing had subsided to some
extent.</p>

<p>Into the shell wrecked town of Sillery I drove,
and I could see in the growing light that many
houses had been levelled to the ground and there
were none at all that did not bear the marks of
battle. I drove into a court yard, inside the gate
of which there was a large shell hole. Stretcher
bearers were waiting for me&mdash;there was no delay
this time. Two men were lifted into the car. They
were suffering very great agony but I could see no
marks of blood. I understood at once&mdash;they were
victims of poison gas.</p>

<p>This time there was no need to drive slowly back
again to the town of Ludes to the hospital. It was
broad daylight when I reached there. A sleepy
stretcher bearer came out carrying a lantern, which
was not needed. The two men were lifted out of
the car and lowered to the ground. They were
writhing in agony&mdash;one of them rolled off his
stretcher into the gutter, and died at my feet. That
was my first night on duty at the front&mdash;that was
my baptism of fire.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">“Raising Hell Down at Epernay”</h4>

<p class="p2">Sir Philip Sidney, for whom I believe I was more
or less hopefully named, gained immortal fame by
giving his last drop of water to a dying comrade on
the field of battle. I desire to mention that I gave
my last cigarette to a perfectly live stretcher bearer
while under shell fire. For twenty-four hours I
had been stationed at the dug-out in the canal bank
in front of the Esperance farm; the place where
I had been the first time I went to post. Several
time since I had gone there and now felt quite at
home in those surroundings.</p>

<p>During the last twenty-four hours shells had
been coming in with a fair regularity. The Germans
were endeavoring to drive out a battery which
evidently had given them some annoyance. In a
comparatively short period I counted more than a
hundred shells, shrieking over my head, striking
and bursting a hundred yards in front of me, throwing
the earth in every direction, the rocks and pieces
of shell spattering around close to where I stood.
Several trees were cut down by the bombardment
and they fell like so many twigs.</p>

<p>I had been alone during those twenty-four hours
and had begun to realize that waiting for a run was
quite as trying as the run itself, particularly as I
could observe that when I did start I would be
obliged to pass uncomfortably close to the corner
where the shells were hitting. Toward the end of
the afternoon some wounded came straggling in.
After twenty-four hours under whistling shells I
was glad to start back to Ludes and to a cigarette.</p>

<p>I spent the early evening at the little Swiss chalet.
About nine o’clock I received a call to carry
two wounded officers back to the town of Epernay.
It was a beautiful, cool, moonlight evening and I
enjoyed the prospect of the peaceful drive away
from the sound of the war, not realizing that there
was a rather interesting evening in store for me. I
drove across the Marne into the town of Epernay
at about eleven o’clock and took one of the wounded
officers to the principal hospital there. The other
officer I was instructed to take on to another hospital,
located at the top of a hill on the outskirts of
the town. Epernay is an old town and the streets
are narrow, winding, and quite as confusing as
Boston, particularly when driving at night without
lights.</p>

<p>As I pulled up the hill out on an open road in
sight of the hospital, I saw a flash of light in the
sky, followed by a sharp report&mdash;then there was
a shower of lights much like rockets followed by a
series of reports. As I stopped the car in the hospital
grounds and was assisting stretcher bearers to
lift out the wounded officer, I could hear the droning
of several aeroplanes overhead but could not
see them. Hospital aides, half dressed in white
trousers, and in bare feet, were crowded in the
doorway. Everyone understood what was happening.
The Germans had come over in numbers for
one of their periodical raids.</p>

<p>Incendiary bombs were now dropping down in
the heart of the town where I had just passed.
Church bells were ringing as a warning for all civilians
to take to their caves&mdash;a warning which
seemed quite superfluous. There was a terrific explosion,
followed by a burst of flames which lighted
up the sky. A building had been set on fire. Standing
beside my car, I took off my fatigue cap and
substituted my steel helmet, which I always carried
with me when not actually wearing it. Steel helmets
have saved many lives. The bombardment
became more furious as time went on&mdash;bombs were
dropping on various parts of the city. Several
powerful searchlights began to sweep the heavens
and two broad shafts of light crossed, and in the
cross they held in view a German plane. It was
flying low and not far overhead from where I
stood. The two searchlights followed the movement
of the plane and held it in the cross while the
anti-aircraft guns opened fire. I could see the
shells bursting underneath the plane but none hit
and quickly the plane flew out of range and disappeared
from sight. But the raiders continued the
bombardment.</p>

<p>Having waited for some time for the firing to
cease I decided to start back for post at Ludes.
Unless there was very good reason for not doing so,
we were expected to return to post as soon as we
had finished the errand which had taken us away.
To drive back it was necessary for me to return
through the heart of the town were the bombs had
fallen and were still falling. So far as possible I
kept on the “shady” side of the street out of the
moonlight, pausing at every corner for a moment.
Sometimes there would be a deafening crash near
by. I would stop&mdash;put my head down and my arms
over my face, then would drive quickly into the
next street. I passed the postoffice just after it
was hit&mdash;pieces of shutters, doors and glass were
littered about the street and I feared for punctured
tires. I drove on a short distance, turned around
and went back, pausing in front of the demolished
building, but could hear no sound. The street was
absolutely deserted. As I continued my drive over
the deserted streets the only sign of humanity I
would see was an occasional soldier with his gun
standing in the comparative shelter of a doorway.</p>

<p>Before leaving the town I stopped for a moment
at the hospital where I had first been and an officer
who could speak a little English asked me to
stay all night in the “cave.” “It is a bad night to
be out,” he said. The invitation was alluring, but I
decided to push on to Ludes.</p>

<p>To get out of the town I must recross the bridge
over the Marne, close to the railroad station, and I
had been informed that raiders were making a particular
effort to hit the station. As I shot out across
the bridge in the broad moonlight, in full view from
above, I could see some freight cars burning. I
wished that some friend were sittting beside me,
but I often wished that on these lonely nerve-racking
night drives.</p>

<p>When I drew out into the open country I felt no
inclination to turn on my lights, for I had heard of
a staff car just a short while before driving over the
same road. The driver had turned on his lights.
The target was seen from an aeroplane&mdash;a bomb
was dropped with accurate aim, demolishing the
car and killing all the occupants.</p>

<p>Reaching Ludes some time in the middle of the
night, I stepped over the form of Curtis, who,
curled up in his blankets, was asleep on the floor.
He awoke and sleepily inquired: “Who’s there?”
I told him. “Anything going on?” he inquired still
sleepily.</p>

<p>“Seem to be raising hell down at Epernay,” I
told him quietly, so as not to awaken anyone who
might be sleeping.</p>

<p>“That so?” muttered Curtis, and with no more
show of interest went back to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day I learned that many houses had
been destroyed. Five wounded soldiers had been
killed in the hospital where I had been invited to
spend the night.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Norton’s Last Ride</h4>

<p class="p2">Frederick Norton and I were new men in an old
Section. We were new men in an old crowd, consequently
when we joined the Section we made no
effort to break into any old established circles.
When off duty together, he and I were accustomed
to taking long walks across the fields and to the
towns behind the lines and on these walks I learned
to know what I already believed&mdash;that he was a
man of exceptional character, quiet, unassuming,
modest; a gentleman in the best sense of the word;
a delightful companion, an ideal soldier. On one
of our walks we talked some of spending “permission”
together on the coast of Brittany.</p>

<p>I remember when I went to post for the first time
Norton stepped up to me and shook hands, wishing
me luck and an interesting trip. That established
a custom between us. After that we always shook
hands when either one or the other of us started
for post.</p>

<p>When we had been in the Section for a short
while we were invited to join three of the older fellows
and to transfer our cots to a tent underneath
the trees just outside the grounds of a very beautiful
château, owned, I believe, by M. Chandon, of
Möet &amp; Chandon. We naturally accepted the invitation
with pleasure and thus we became established
as members of the old crowd. Formalities
ceased from that time.</p>

<p>The château had been converted into a hospital
and at night a lighted red cross over the large iron
gates showed the entrance to approaching cars.</p>

<p>We had some pleasant evenings under the trees
when off duty, even though we could hear the distant
firing of the guns. We sang some, a guitar
and mandolin also furnished music. We listened to
New Townsend reminisce about his experiences in
Belgium in the early part of the war. Frank Farnham
and “Red” Day occasionally sang a duet without
much persuasion. With difficulty “Farney”
was prevailed on to yodel. On one occasion Ned
Townsend danced the dance of the seven veils by
moonlight. Sometimes we would hear the whirr
of an aeroplane overhead. The light in our tent
would be extinguished by the first man who could
reach it and silence would reign.</p>

<p>So in spite of the war there were many pleasant
moments. A spirit of comradeship grew up between
us all. Under such conditions, sharing the
same dangers, the some hardships, the same pleasures,
we grew to know each other better in a short
space of time than would have been possible in
years in the ordinary peaceful walks of life.</p>

<p>Ned Townsend, the oldest man in point of service,
remarked that the best of fellowship had always
prevailed in Section One&mdash;that it had always
been more like a club in that respect than a military
organization. He also mentioned casually that
Section One had almost always been lucky&mdash;very
few casualties had marked its long, arduous and
dangerous career at the front.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of July 12 I saw Frederick
Norton starting for the front, and, following our
custom, I went over to his car, shook hands with
him and wished him “good luck.” I told him the
next time we were off duty together we must take a
walk over the neighboring hills to inspect a windmill
which had been erected about the time Columbus
discovered America. Then he was off to the town
of Ludes&mdash;to the little Swiss chalet hidden behind
the trees.</p>

<p>That night was a bright moonlight night&mdash;an
ideal night for avions. Early in the evening those
of us at Louvoise were having music under the
trees. A few convalescent soldiers from the château
hospital were sitting about in the grass, listening.
As the moon came up and shone through
the trees I recall “Red” Day remarking: “The
avions will be over to-night,” and a short while after
we heard the unmistakable crash of an avion bomb
down the road in the direction of Epernay.</p>

<p>It must have been pretty close to eleven o’clock
that Frederick Norton was standing in the back
window of the little Swiss chalet at Ludes, from
which place he could get a glimpse of the battle
lines through the boughs of the trees. He was waiting
for his call to go to the front. His call was soon
to come. He no doubt heard the whirr of the approaching
aeroplane overhead&mdash;he may have heard
the deafening crash of the bomb as it struck the
ground, making a crater in the earth and riddling
the walls of the peaceful chalet. But then the
sound of the war was forever silenced&mdash;for him. A
piece of the shell had cut his throat&mdash;another had
pierced his heart. He pitched forward, then fell
backward on the floor. He had answered his final
call.</p>

<p>The following night I walked beside my friend
Frederick Norton for the last time. He was not
laid to rest until after dusk because his burial place
was on the side of a hill in view of the enemy&mdash;in
view of the towers of the desecrated cathedral at
Rheims&mdash;as fine a place as any for a volunteer who
had earned an honorable rest.</p>

<p>There were French officers of high rank in the
gathering to pay homage to the Volunteer American&mdash;a
priest, a Protestant chaplain, his friends in
Section One&mdash;a squad of soldiers under arms. As
we stood there in the growing dusk a German aeroplane
flew overhead and swept the roadside nearby
with its rapid fire gun. All looked up but no one
moved. The benediction being said, we walked
slowly away.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Bastille Day</h4>

<p class="p2">July 14, 1917, was “Bastille Day,” the great
French national holiday, and the troops were greatly
heartened by the fact that at last America was
coming over to help them win the war. French and
American troops were to parade together in Paris&mdash;the
fighters at the front were to have a special
dinner, with a cup of champagne and a cigar. A
few of the men in our Section who had a short leave
of absence coming due were going into Paris for a
couple of days.</p>

<p>Personally, I was glad that I was going out to
the front on duty. I felt the need of active, strenuous
work. During the forenoon several shells came
shrieking over the little Swiss chalet, striking in a
field a short distance back. A little while later I
saw a dead soldier being carried into the town by
his comrades. One shell struck in a field outside the
town where a young girl was working in the vineyard
and she was obliged to desert her work and
run for shelter. I wondered if the Germans had
observed the movements of our ambulances in and
out of the grounds of the chalet or whether they
were merely observing the French holiday. Some
one remarked that following a custom of three years
standing, they would do what they could to disturb
the holiday dinner of the French soldiers. About
noon a couple of shells struck in the town of Ludes
but did no great amount of damage. A few civilians
were still living in Ludes and in the kitchen of
a little French woman we ate our meals when not
out on a run. We supplied the food and she cooked
for us. I remember during my first luncheon in that
kitchen seeing her send her little daughters off to
school with gas masks flung across their shoulders.</p>

<p>“Bastille Day” was a fairly busy afternoon and
that night there was no time to rest. Sometimes it
was a call to go out to the Esperance farm&mdash;sometimes
a call to run into the town of Sillery&mdash;sometimes
to report at the Château Romont back of
Sillery to await further orders.</p>

<p>That night I had no sleep at all, though I made
several efforts. Early in the evening I found myself
at the Château Romont, and when I was going
to retire for a little rest I was not shown down into
the dark cellar where I slept for a short while the
first night I had been there. I was invited into a
large back room in the château which had once evidently
been a handsome billiard room. On the walls
were deer antlers and a boar’s head. The billiard
table had been pushed over in a corner of the room
out of the way and in its place was a table at which
officers sat poring over maps and reports. A telephone
was on the table and on the walls were large
maps. I stretched out on a bare rough “crib” to
rest. One of the officers called an orderly and said
something to him which I did not hear. The orderly
went into another room and returned with an
armful of rugs. He placed them in the crib and
once more I stretched out on this most comfortable
couch. But just then the telephone rang. I got up,
pulled on my boots, put on my coat, and as I started
out the officer at the table smiled sympathetically
at me and said “Bon nuit.”</p>

<p>Midnight in the little Swiss chalet. I had returned
from a run and had lain down to sleep just
outside the room where two nights before Frederick
Norton had fallen. Again there was a call. Some
time after one o’clock, at the dug-out in the canal
bank in front of the Esperance farm, I again lay
down, only to be called a few minutes later. I drove
down the road to a post I had not visited before, and
while the wounded were being placed in the car I
was instructed to shut off my motor for fear the
Germans might hear and open fire. The car being
filled with three wounded men on stretchers inside,
and one less seriously wounded on the front seat
with me, I started off for Ludes. Along the road
I struck a small shell hole which gave the car a
severe jolt and the wounded inside cried out: “Oh,
comrade! comrade!” In the morning I discovered
that the jolt had cracked the front spring of the car
but the wounded had forgiven me for my poor
driving.</p>

<p>At Ludes the hospital was filled and I must push
on back to the town of Epernay to one of the hospitals
there. As I drove into the town at daylight
I saw a strange sight. Straggling into the town
were old men, women and children, all looking worn
and bedraggled. Some carried blankets, some were
pushing little carts in which were piled up household
belongings. Some of the women were carrying
babies in their arms.</p>

<p>The night before a warning had gone out that an
air raid was expected and these civilians living under
the shadow of the war had taken to the “caves” on
the outskirts of the city for protection.</p>

<p>I reached the principal hospital in the town and,
as frequently happened, was sent to another hospital
further on. When I arrived there I was feeling
tired, bedraggled, hungry and out of sorts myself
after the all night strain. But if I felt like complaining
I promptly changed my mind and decided
to be cheerful.</p>

<p>Stopping my car, I went around to the back and
raised the curtain. One of the wounded, a young
fellow, looked up at me with the pleasantest expression
in the world and said: “Hello, boy
Americaine! Good morning!”</p>

<p>But that is the spirit of the French.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Here Kultur Passed</h4>

<p class="p2">Toward the end of July we received orders that
we were to move from the Champagne region, but
we did not know just where we were to be sent.
Early one morning, the order to move having come,
we had loaded our cars with tents, supplies, automobile
parts, all the paraphernalia of an ambulance
section, and our personal belongings, and had
formed in a line on the main thoroughfare of the
picturesque town of Louvois. Stevenson drove up
to the head of the procession, blew his whistle once
and every engine was started; he blew his whistle
twice, and we were off down the road in the direction
of Epernay. The villagers of Louvois were
on the street to wave us “Au ’voir.” There were
old men, women and girls. The young men were
all at the front.</p>

<p>Outside the town of Epernay we drew up alongside
the road and waited further instructions. Some
thought we were going to Belgium, others said
we were going down into the Verdun sector. Our
French Lieutenant, Reymond, had gone on ahead
in his car for orders. Presently he returned and we
learned that we were to drive in the direction of
Verdun.</p>

<p>Stevenson, at the head of the procession, blew
his whistle and once more all cars were started&mdash;soon
we were rolling along the road.</p>

<p>At noon we reached Châlons, where we had luncheon
in a café crowded with French officers. By late
afternoon we reached the outskirts of the town of
Vietry, and as we drove into the town we saw a
squad of German prisoners, under guard, marching
along the road. If they noticed that we were Americans,
they showed no emotion even if they felt any.
At Vietry we were to spend the night. We were
shown to a large barn in which to sleep. Some
Russian troops had occupied the barn a short while
before and the straw littered about looked rather
risky. As it promised to be a clear night some of us
decided to sleep out in the open field under the
trees. The cows were less to be feared than the
straw in the barn or even the avions above.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 <p class="caption">The Last of Ambulance <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4</p>
</div>

<p>Having parked our cars, several of us strolled to
the banks of the historic Marne and were quickly
splashing around in the refreshing though muddy
water. Then over to a café in the city for supper.
The supper developed into a banquet. It was the
first time in a great while that the entire Section and
its French attachés had all sat together at one time
and everyone off duty. Singing commenced before

the meal was half over, and if not all harmonious
it was at least hearty. The darkness came on but
no lights were made in the room on account of
danger from the avions, but the hilarity did not die
out in the growing gloom.</p>

<p>Roy Stockwell was obliged to sing several verses
of a war song which was called “Around Her Leg
She Wore a Purple Ribbon,” in which every one
joined in the chorus, singing:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“Far away, far away,</div>
  <div class="i0">She wore it for her lover</div>
  <div class="i0">Who was far, far away.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>“Winnie” Wertz, the French cook, sang a pastoral
song of peaceful life on the farm after the war
was over. One or two men tried to make speeches
but received scant encouragement. The singing
continued till late in the evening, when we wended
our way back to the open field for a night of peaceful
sleep under the trees. As we walked through
the city on the way a quartette was lustily singing:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“Far away, far away,</div>
  <div class="i0">She wore it for her lover,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who was far, far away.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>No doubt the French inhabitants awoke to shrug
a shoulder and patiently mutter: “Oh, those terrible
Americans.”</p>

<p>The next morning we were on our way to Bar
le Duc, a picturesque city nestled between high hills.
At the top of one of these hills, as we started the
steep descent into the city, we passed a large convent
almost totally destroyed by avion bombs. Bar
le Duc is always subject to air raids and shows many
marks of the war on its principal streets. Again
we stopped for the night and here I slept on the
sidewalk with my head against a sentry box so that
no one would fall over me.</p>

<p>On to the town of Evres through a country, as
we advanced, showing more and more plainly the
desolation and waste of the war. Through towns
deserted of all civilians, over roads dry in the midsummer
sun and unspeakably dusty from the continual
travel toward the front. One afternoon in
Evres, Curtis and I dropped into the home of an
elderly French peasant woman for a lunch of delicious
cottage cheese and a jug of fresh milk. The
peasant woman had a sad story to tell. Her husband
was dead; her son’s home in the village had
been destroyed; he had been taken prisoner and his
wife had fallen victim to the advance of Prussian
kultur.</p>

<p>At Evres we waited to move on to Verdun and
there we learned of the great offensive that was soon
to take place and we watched the preparations for
it on a vast scale. We were deeply impressed.</p>

<div class="chapter"><a name="Chap_11" id="Chap_11"></a>
<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Eleven">XI</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Verdun</h4>

<p class="p2">When we moved up on the morning of August
first to take our small part in the big offensive, we
established our cantonment in the town of Houdainville,
within about three miles of the city of Verdun.
The town of Houdainville was conspicuously a war
town, being deserted by all civilians, crowded with
troops and subject to intermittent shelling. The
houses were all old and many bore the marks of battle.
Some of our men were billeted together in the
second story of a building which was infested with
rats. The quarters were so small that it was necessary
to crowd the cots uncomfortably close together.
Others of us pitched a tent in a barnyard. It was
muddy, unsavory and very different from the place
at Louvais, where we had our tent pitched under
the trees outside the château of M. Chandon. We
realized that we were not to see the war at its worst
and we felt reconciled to added hardships by the fact
that our Section had been assigned to the very serious
work ahead.</p>

<p>That there was very serious work ahead, indeed,
had been brought home to us while having seen for
days and nights the continual stream of troops,
heavy guns, supplies and munitions moving toward
the front. We had been told that preparations for
this offensive had been going on for months.</p>

<p>Had I been so inclined, which I was not, there
was little time to complain of our surroundings&mdash;barely
time to note them before I was sent out to
post duty. Now we were to be on post duty for
twenty-four hours and then off duty for twenty-four
hours, in which to work on our cars and rest. This
schedule was based on all of the cars in the Section
being able to run, but there were times when some
of the cars were not available.</p>

<p>I was sent out to a post at Cassairne Marceau,
at the top of a hill about three miles in front of Verdun,
near the spot which marks the extreme advance
of the Crown Prince in his attack of 1916. Near
here the French had stood and said: “They shall
not pass.” They never did, and I am sure they
never will.</p>

<p>Looking back from Cassairne Marceau I could
see the ancient fortified city of Verdun, crowned by
its cathedral on a hill. Close at hand were the remains
of barracks built shortly before the war. All
about was desolation, shell holes, pieces of exploded
shells. In front of the post was a graveyard and
during my many times at that post there was not a
day that I did not see the dead being laid to rest.
Here the war was seen in its most hideous aspect.
Sometimes a wagon would come rumbling up to the
post with dead piled up like so much cordwood.</p>

<p>My first call to go from here to a front line post
came before sunset. The post was near Fort Vaux.
An officer rode with me to observe whether the road
could be covered by a car. It was a road that no
sane person would undertake in peace times under
any consideration. Down a ravine between two
hills, in a country laid absolutely barren by continual
shell fire, the sides of the hills were pock-marked
with shell holes; and where at one time, three years
before, there had been a beautiful forest, there was
not now a tree stump, a bush or a patch of grass.
We drove along the road very slowly indeed, for
there was danger of breaking springs and axles in
passing, as we drove close to the artillery as they
were firing. I was later glad for the opportunity
of seeing that road before sunset, for I sometimes
covered it afterward in the darkness without lights.</p>

<p>We reached the poste de secour, picked up three
wounded artillerymen and returned with added caution
to Cassairne Marceau. It was very trying
when we wanted to drive fast, in order to get back
as quickly as possible to a place of comparative
safety, that we were obliged to drive most slowly to
save our wounded and our cars.</p>

<p>Sometime around eleven o’clock that night I lay
down on a stretcher in the dug-out at Cassairne
Marceau to snatch a little sleep while waiting for
my next call. At that time I was still in good condition
and had not yet suffered from great fatigue or
undue nervous strain and consequently could sleep
at any time and in any place that the opportunity
offered. Later on I was to become so fatigued and
my nerves were so shaken from the continual strain
that I could not sleep at all. The dug-out served
as a dressing station and was equipped for operations&mdash;surgeons
were in attendance there. The place
had the odor of a hospital, with the added unpleasant
damp odor of the underground. Not a very
satisfactory place in which to sleep, but we slept
there many times.</p>

<p>I was just dozing off when I heard voices, footsteps
and a moaning which was very distressing; and
I was sufficiently conscious to realize that some one
badly wounded was being carried in. But I must
rest&mdash;I must sleep while the opportunity offered,
so I dozed fitfully, never being quite unconscious of
the fact that close by me an operation was being performed.
Finally I was fully awakened by some one
touching my foot. I sat up&mdash;the operation had been
completed and I was to take the desperately wounded
man back to a hospital in Verdun.</p>

<p>It was well past midnight when the man was
lifted into the car and I started on my dark ride,
driving slowly. I had not yet been inside the walled
city of Verdun. I did not know just where the hospital
was. I had simply been informed that by
crossing a certain bridge, entering a certain gate and
turning down a certain street I would find it. I carried
few wounded men who moaned in greater
agony than did this soldier as I drove on back to
Verdun. I found the bridge and crossed it. I
passed through the gate inside the city walls and I
drove slowly through the dark, silent, apparently
deserted city. It seemed indeed like a city of the
dead. I came to a square and in the darkness took
the wrong street. I was doing the best that could
be done, and I hoped the wounded soldier would live
till we reached the hospital. I wished for someone
to talk to&mdash;for some one to help me find the way.
Finally I saw a sentinel on duty and he directed me
down the right street and before long we came to
the house which was serving as a hospital.</p>

<p>That was my first entrance into the ancient fortified
city of Verdun. When I saw the inside of my
car at daylight I was glad that we had met with the
sentinel when we did, for I think there could have
been but little time to lose.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Awaiting the Big Attack</h4>

<p class="p2">We had not been many days at Houdainville
when we received orders to move up to Beveaux,
just a short distance outside the walled city of Verdun.
The big attack had not yet taken place but
was expected at any time. In the meanwhile the
artillery activity was daily increasing.</p>

<p>At Beveaux there was a large hospital which was
almost vacant when we moved up there and pitched
our tents. It had been made ready for the big attack
and would probably accommodate fifteen hundred
wounded. The preparations for the offensive
were most impressive and tended to make us
thoughtful. Though we were now closer to the
front, the location of our cantonment on high, open
ground was a welcome change to all of us. Those
of us who in Houdainville had our tent in that
muddy, unsavory barnyard were glad to get out.
Those in the Section who had slept in the crowded,
rat-ridden house, were more than glad of the
change. That we were close to the war, in fact
actually under it, even when off duty, was impressed
upon us at supper time that first evening at Beveaux,
when several shells struck within the hospital
grounds and some hit the large stables adjoining,
killing horses and wounding men. We all ran for
shelter, and supper was delayed for some time.
The hospital was shelled on several occasions after
that.</p>

<p>During our stay at Beveaux we usually retired at
night with most of our clothes on, partly on account
of the avions and partly because our work was so
arduous that we were likely to be called in the night,
even when supposedly off duty. On retiring we
always had our steel helmets and gas masks within
reach. Frequently at night when the avions came
over we were obliged to get out of bed and run for
the nearby trenches. A canvas tent affords mightly
little protection against shell fire!</p>

<p>We expected to be at Beveaux for but a very
short time before being sent back for a rest, but
the days went on, the long nights went on and the
weeks rolled around before we were relieved.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Thirteen">XIII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Under Fire in an Ambulance</h4>

<p class="p2">Twenty-four hours on duty&mdash;twenty-four hours
off duty: that was the schedule in the Verdun sector,
based on all the cars being able to run, but there
was not a day or night that cars were not put out of
commission, which meant that the work of those
who were running was increased. Theoretically
speaking that was the schedule; practically speaking
there was no schedule. Sometimes we were on
duty thirty hours at a stretch, though perhaps in
that time we could snatch a little sleep between
runs; sometimes there was no sleep at all. The
days were bad, the nights were worse, and day or
night, either on or off duty, we were always under
fire. Almost every time a man came back from
post he had an experience to tell&mdash;it seemed that
on our runs we escaped by a matter of seconds;
shells were always hitting just behind us, in front
of us and around us. We saw bloodshed all the
time. The Twenty-third Psalm speaks of “the
valley of the shadow of death.” That describes the
desolate land about where we were. Verdun will
go down in history as the slaughter house of the
world. This was real warfare.</p>

<p>We were working hard all the time but we were
buoyed up by the fact that soon, almost any day,
the big attack would take place and then we would
be sent back for a rest. The attack was to have
taken place on August first but was postponed from
day to day so that more guns might be moved into
position, and more supplies, munitions and men
moved up. Every night on the road we saw that
endless procession of supply trucks, munitions,
guns and men.</p>

<p>We were covering many posts&mdash;we were getting
very tired even before the attack took place. One
night the General commanding a division at Fort
Houdrement asked for more cars to be stationed
there and he was informed that were no more cars
to spare.</p>

<p>He asked “Why?” and was informed that all of
our cars were out.</p>

<p>He asked “Where?” and he was informed of the
various posts that we were covering. He expressed
great surprise. He thought we were merely serving
his division. We were serving an entire Army
Corps.</p>

<p>Fort Houdrement was a bad spot and it was a
hard road to travel to reach there, but bad as it
was there were other posts which most of us came
to dread more. I first saw Fort Houdremont in
broad daylight. Before that our cars had only gone
there at night, because the road was so exposed.
That I first went there in daylight was not because
of bravery on my part or because of a desire to establish
a precedent. It was just the result of an
accident.</p>

<p>I had turned in to sleep one night&mdash;or to sleep as
much of the night as might be possible. A couple
of my friends had also lain down to sleep. As we
lay in the darkness under the shelter of the tent we
could hear the firing of the artillery all along the
front. Then a sudden gust of cool wind blew the
flaps of the tent and we heard the patter of rain
above our heads. A thunder storm was coming on.
The sound of the thunder was mingled with the
noise of the artillery. Our tent was occasionally
lighted by flashes of lightning and I could see my
companions lying awake on their cots. The rain
came down in torrents, the lightning became louder
and the roar of the artillery less distinct, until when
the storm had reached its height the pouring rain
and the sound of the thunder drowned out the sound
of the artillery. And as we lay there one of my
friends spoke up in the darkness and said quietly:
“Phil, it sounds as if God in Heaven is still omnipotent.”
And I said: “Yes, I am glad that God
in Heaven is still omnipotent in spite of the fact
that the tent is leaking right over my face.” Then
I pulled the blankets over my head and dozed off
to sleep&mdash;but not for long.</p>

<p>I was soon awakened and told it was my turn out.
It was still raining hard and I could hear the thunder
and see the flashes of lightning as I bundled up
and went out to my car and started out to find Fort
Houdremont. I had never been there. I merely
had a general direction as to where it was. It was
a bad night for a ten-mile ride to a post I had never
been to. It was not quite midnight when I started.
The roads were slippery and crowded with traffic
and progress was slow. About four miles out traffic
was blocked for over half an hour, part of which
time I dozed sitting at the wheel. Then once more
motors began to whirr, trucks were groaning, horses
were pulling and tugging, officers on horseback
were shouting orders.</p>

<p>The procession moved on, getting nearer the
battle, and along the road we could see the flashes
of fire from the artillery and the exploding shells as
they struck. On through the town of Bras, a desolate
shell wrecked place, then on about a half a
mile beyond. There I saw a chance to make time
and gain ground by pulling out of the procession,
driving ahead and crowding into an opening further
on. A large motor truck loomed up in front
of me. I turned sharply to escape being hit and
ran into a ditch. I was hopelessly stalled.</p>

<p>One of our cars, driven by Holt, came directly
back of me. He stopped to see if he could give me
help. I told him it was impossible for us to pull
the car out. He saw that for himself and as he
drove on he shouted “Good-night” to me and I
called back “Good-night” to him.</p>

<p>He could not have gone far when I saw a shell
burst directly down the road over which he had
gone. I wondered how close a call he had. Next
day he told me he had jumped out of his car and
was crouching in a ditch when the shell struck.</p>

<p>I stood alongside of my car in the rain and mud,
shells coming in along the road as the procession of
the night moved past me. Every one had his work
to do and must move on. Once four poilus paused
long enough to see whether they could help push
my car out of the ditch, but it was useless and they
went on.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to wait for daylight;
and it was a long wait. During the night two
horses were killed beside my car.</p>

<p>The dawn came on slowly, the rain stopped, the
firing became less intense. The procession of the
night had disappeared I knew not where. An
empty ammunition wagon came clattering up the
road, the driver cracking his whip and urging the
four horses to greater speed. When the sun finally
appeared I found myself alone in view of the enemy.
Alone, excepting for the two dead horses lying
in the road. Then I went for help.</p>

<p>I walked back to the town of Bras and if it
looked forlorn at night it looked even more so in
the daylight. Places where some houses had once
stood were now merely marked by débris tumbled
into the cellars&mdash;dead horses were lying about. A
French ambulance gave me a lift back to Verdun
and there I found one of our cars which took me
back to our cantonment, where I reported my difficulties.
Stevenson called to Hanna, who was off
duty, and in his car we three drove back over the
road to where I had abandoned my ambulance.</p>

<p>I really was sceptical about finding anything
more than a pile of wreckage, but the car was still
there and so were the two dead horses. Before we
proceeded to pull my car out with the aid of Hanna’s
car, I tenderly lifted an unexploded shell from
under the rear wheel, carried it over to the other
side of the road and laid it down.</p>

<p>Then on to Houdrement&mdash;Stevenson riding with
me and Hanna following in his car. Reaching
there, we walked up the side of a steep hill to the
dressing station and inquired for any wounded that
might be there. I was caked with mud from head
to foot. A French officer smiled at my appearance.
I saluted and he extended his hand. The French
officers were usually quite as polite to us as if we
were officers ourselves.</p>

<p>We found some wounded who would otherwise
have been kept there until darkness had set in. After
that our Section covered the run to Fort Houdremont
in daylight with regularity; and in spite
of the fact that the road was exposed to view, most
of us found the daylight run much less nerve-racking
than in the night.</p>

<p>“Do the boche fire on ambulances?” I have sometimes
been asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” I have answered.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">The Big Shells Come Over</h4>

<p class="p2">The days and nights went on, but still the attack
did not take place, but the artillery duels were
growing in intensity every night.</p>

<p>If there was any belief that preparations for the
attack were not known, this belief was dispelled
when the Germans erected a sign over their trenches
reading&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">We will be waiting for you on the fifteenth</span>”&mdash;but
the fifteenth passed by and&mdash;the attack
did not take place. We were getting very
tired&mdash;we were becoming conscious that we had
nerves&mdash;the driving became more hazardous and
terrifying with the increased activity of the artillery.</p>

<p>Early on the evening of August seventeenth,
I was off duty and was standing talking to some
of the fellows, enjoying an after supper pipe and
watching the anti-aircraft guns popping at a German
aeroplane when Stevenson walked up. He
said a telephone message had just come in informing
him that Stockwell had broken the front spring
of his car out at Fort Houdremont. I was to take
a new spring out and Pearl was to go along to help
make the repairs.</p>

<p>William Pearl was our volunteer mechanician
and had been with the Section for some time. Before
that he had been a Rhodes scholar. After the
war he would practice law.</p>

<p>Pearl and I started off and we had not gone far
when it began to rain&mdash;it frequently rained at Verdun.
We stopped to slip our rubber ponchos over
our heads. Perhaps that brief delay was the cause
of what happened shortly after. A matter of seconds
sometimes changes destiny when at the front.
I recall that on one occasion I slowed down my car
for a few seconds, just long enough to light a cigarette,
and as I paused a shell struck on the road, not
far in front of me. I am sure but for the lighting
of that cigarette, the shell would have scored a direct
hit. Yet some people say that cigarettes are
an unmixed evil!</p>

<p>We drove on in the rain along the bank of the
Meuse past the city of Verdun, up a long hill along
which were formed the troops, the munition trucks,
the cannon, the camions waiting to move toward the
front under darkness; and when the procession once
started to move, we knew from experience that
progress would be slow along the road. So we
drove as rapidly as possible, and as we drove, we
got into conversation and Pearl told me that in all
his experience Section One had never known anything
worse that what we had been through at Verdun.
I had heard Ned Townsend say the same
thing, and Townsend had been at the front most of
the time since the war started.</p>

<p>As we began to descend the long hill, we could
see shells striking near the road and when we
reached the bottom of the hill, we came to a large
camion ditched and deserted on one side of the road
and on the other side of the road a large shell hole.
It was now dusk and I stopped my car to see
whether I could pass without running into the hole.
Then we heard the terrific shriek to which our ears
had become accustomed&mdash;and then the crash. Pearl
had stepped partly from the seat and had crouched
down&mdash;I had put my head down and covered my
face with my arms. The pieces of shell and rocks
spattered around the car and hit it in several places.
Each fraction of a second I expected to feel a stinging
sensation but I quickly came to a realization
that I was not scratched. I raised my head and
asked&mdash;“Are you all right, Pearl?” Then I saw
a magnificent display of calm courage. As he stood
up, Pearl replied as quietly as if he had discovered
something wrong with the front tire: “I think my
arm is gone.”</p>

<p>It was not gone but badly shattered. With nerves
calm and head cool, though he was bleeding badly,
he got up on the seat beside me. The nearest dressing
station was at Houdrement and we drove on. I
am not sure, but I think a shell must have struck behind
us at that moment because I later discovered
a hole in the rear curtain of the car and the rear
hub cap was cut as if by a steel chisel.</p>

<p>At Houdrement we left the car at the cross roads
and started to climb the steep muddy embankment
to reach the dressing post. Pearl was losing blood
and getting weak, but still calm. I am sure he was
more calm than I was. While his wound was being
dressed I telephoned and reported the accident
to Stevenson. I reported that I would remain at
Houdrement with Pearl until he could be moved.
There was some question as to whether he might be
obliged to stay all night, but it was finally decided
to move him back to the hospital at Beveaux without
waiting.</p>

<p>It was now pitch dark and the roads were crowded
with traffic coming toward the front. Progress
was extremely slow on the way back. We would
perhaps drive a quarter of a mile and then be held
up for a quarter of an hour. Shells were arriving
and shells were departing. It was a bad night, but
all nights were hideously bad in front of Verdun.
Whenever we stopped, I would open the little front
door of the car and ask Pearl how he felt and always
would come back the reply, “All right.” Once
we were held up for an unusually long time and I
walked ahead to see what was holding up the traffic.
It was a large gun that had become ditched and
men and horses and trucks were pulling and groaning
and straining. Finally we were on our way
and without further bad delays we reached the hospital
at Beveaux. It had taken us two hours to
cover less than ten miles.</p>

<p>I saw Pearl carried from his stretcher and tucked
in bed and then I could not refrain from telling him
what I felt: “Pearl, you have got about the finest,
coolest nerve of any man I have ever seen.”</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Under the Shell Shower</h4>

<p class="p2">Still the attack did not take place and still we
were staying on and getting very tired.</p>

<p>On the morning and afternoon of the twentieth,
I made several trips to Houdremont. Late in the
afternoon we heard that the long delayed and much
heralded attack would start that night. As I was
returning to Houdremont about five o’clock, Stevenson
instructed me to wait there until midnight
for wounded and then to return and go off duty.</p>

<p>At dusk began the most terrific artillery firing
that I had ever heard. There was not a second’s
cessation in the firing&mdash;it was as continual and rapid
as the rolling of a snare drum. Standing on the hill
in front of the poste de secours at Houdrement in
front of the French guns the shells were slipping
through the air; that is the way they sounded, as
if they were being shot along greased planes. I
not only heard the departing shells, I actually saw
them&mdash;black spots flying through space. At first
I was sceptical. I thought perhaps my vision had
become impaired or perhaps it was the effect of
deranged nerves, but I asked White if he could see
what I did and he said he could. Night came on
and soon the men in the trenches would “go over
the top” for the final rush. If it was a strain for us,
the waiting must have been a most terrible strain
for them. There were several other cars besides
mine at Houdrement as night came on, but I would
be the last to leave. Stretcher bearers, their faces
set and worn, came in bearing wounded.</p>

<p>Patterson’s car was loaded and he started back
over the bombarded road for Beveaux. Hanna’s
car was loaded and he started back. White’s car
was loaded and at the foot of the hill his car broke
down and under shrapnel fire the wounded were
transferred to another car. Kirtsburg’s car was
loaded and he started back. Then I was the only
one left. I sat down beside a stretcher bearer and
we smoked in silence. The waiting seemed unbearable,
listening to the ceaseless thunder of the guns.
I fully realized, when I did start, just what I must
pass through to get back to the hospital at Beveaux,
nearly ten miles away. I wondered how much
longer I must wait. I began to realize for the first
time how men were glad to be slightly wounded in
order to get out of that hell. Pieces of shell were
spattering around where we sat, so we went inside
underground. A soldier who had been brought in
just a little while before was raving and fighting&mdash;he
had gone insane. Gendarmes threw him to the
floor.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock an operation was being performed,
and as we stood close to the operating table, my
friend the stretcher bearer brought me a cup of tea.
I thought at the moment the strain of waiting to
go into the inferno outside was the worst experience
I had ever known. But at last the time came&mdash;my
ambulance was loaded and I started back&mdash;not
by way of Bras, because gas was coming in and
settling in the lowlands, but up a steep long hill
which at least would be comparatively free from
gas&mdash;every inch of the way passing artillery pounding
incessantly, so that I could not distinguish the
difference between the sound of arriving and departing
shells. The flashes of fire in my face were
so blinding that I was obliged time and again to
pause and get my bearings, to avoid running off
the road.</p>

<p>Three times while pulling up that long hill, the
engine of my car stalled and I would climb over the
wounded soldier sitting by my side and get the engine
started again. I felt fatigued almost to the
breaking point. I felt sure that if I reached Beveaux
I would be physically unable to drive again
that night. I thought of the weary, drawn faces of
those stretcher bearers back at Houdremont, silently
going out and silently returning with their
burdens. I thought of my own face. This was
not vanity&mdash;it was simply that my face seemed to
pinch at the cheek bones.</p>

 <p class="caption">Where Men Live Like Rats and With Them</p>
</div>

<p>On I went until my car, jerking and limping on
three cylinders, drew up on the grounds at the Beveaux
hospital. But after the car had stopped, it
still seemed to be moving. Others told me they
had experienced the same sensation, when they had
almost reached the point of exhaustion.</p>

<p>I walked over to our dining tent&mdash;stumbled over
a guy rope and went inside. I had absolute confidence
in the forethought of Stevenson. I struck
a match, found some cold meat, a piece of bread
and a cup of pinard; then I tumbled into my cot.</p>

<p>All along the front I could hear the incessant
pounding of the guns, like the rolling of a snare
drum, and then I fell asleep.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Aftermath of Battle</h4>

<p class="p2">The attack had taken place&mdash;thousands had been
killed and wounded on both sides of the lines, but
the French had taken many German prisoners.
They had advanced their lines&mdash;they had gained
important hills. The Germans had been driven
back. The attack had been a success.</p>

<p>But still no relief came for us, we must stay on,
“just for three or four days longer,” through the
counter attack of the Germans. We stayed on
through the counter attack. Events were happening
fast to us. A couple of our men had taken sick&mdash;had
broken down under the strain and been sent
in to Paris. Gamble had broken his arm cranking
his car and he was sent in to Paris. Oller developed
appendicitis and was sent to a hospital a little further
back from the lines for an operation. The hospital
where he went was shelled and some of the occupants
were killed. Oller had stayed on much
longer than most men would in his condition. Holt
was gassed&mdash;Buhl was gassed&mdash;Patterson was
gassed; but they stayed on. Drivers were all having
narrow escapes.</p>

<p>Young Tapley had just loaded his car with
wounded when a big shell came shrieking in. Tapley
threw himself on his face as the shell struck and
exploded close to his car. The sides of the car were
blown out and all the wounded were instantly
killed. White was lying on his face close to him.
Another car was squarely hit and completely demolished.
Fortunately no one was in it at the moment.
Cram, while driving at night, wearing a gas
mask, drove over a twenty-foot embankment&mdash;he
rolled out of the car on a dead horse&mdash;he fell into a
trench on a dead man. A gendarme on horseback,
shot in the breast by shrapnel, toppled from his horse
directly in front of Purdy’s car. There was not a
single car in the Section which was not hit at least
once. “Red” Day, who had succeeded Pearl as
mechanician, was kept working night and morning
and his untiring toil helped to save the Section and
keep it rolling.</p>

<p>We had been relieved from the run to Houdremont
and were now centring our efforts on the
posts as far as Fort Douaumont; and that was worse,
because the roads were exposed to view most of the
way. The country was laid absolutely barren and
along the way, men burrowed holes in the ground
and lived like rats&mdash;and with them. In the day time
we might drive along those roads and see scarcely
a human being, and yet thousands of human beings
were all about us. As we drove along, rats would
scurry across the roads. Once I saw a dead rat in
the middle of the road and it made me pessimistic.
Dead horses were lying about which long since
should have been covered over had time permitted.
Sometimes wounded horses were staggering about
the road, suffering pitifully and impeding traffic.
On one of these occasions, our French Lieutenant
Reymond drove out and with a revolver shot several
of the wounded horses and then had them
cleared from the road. Under fire Reymond was
calm, he was magnificent. Back at Louvois I had
liked Reymond, but at Verdun I admired him.</p>

<p>Along the roads I sometimes saw big shell holes,
enormous craters which made me very thoughtful.
We were under fire day and night, whether on or
off duty. Overhead, we daily watched the air duels
of the avions. Sometimes a German plane would
come across, flying straight, swift and low to attack
an observation balloon and as it opened fire, we
would see the man in the observation basket shoot
straight down through the air, then his parachute
would open up and perhaps he would land in safety.
On one occasion I saw a French plane collapse in
the air and come swirling down like a dead leaf&mdash;down,
down, crashing to the ground, and I drove
on not feeling a single sensation. I was dead
tired and had passed the stage of feeling a thrill
even of horror.</p>

<p>At night the avions were always overhead, dropping
bombs&mdash;sometimes a munition plant would be
hit and explosion after explosion would light the
sky for several hours. Still we stayed on&mdash;the relief
did not come.</p>

<p>And while we were voluntarily and willingly, yes
even very cheerfully, under fire for the cause, it
was most shocking to read in the papers that disloyalty
went unpunished back in the United States.
Our troops Over There are entitled to the assurance
that it is not safe for anyone at home to stab them
in the back.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Seventeen">XVII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">In the Valley of the Shadow</h4>

<p class="p2">On the morning of September first, after we had
been at Verdun for a month under fire, as we were
eating breakfast, three Englishmen walked into our
dining tent. They were members of Section One,
English Ambulance Corps. They informed us
that their Section had been sent up to relieve us.
We were elated. We invited them to sit down for
breakfast with us, for we wanted to be decently
polite and reserved. A little later it turned out they
had been misinformed. They had merely been sent
up to assist us. We were dejected. We were to
stay on, “just three or four days longer.”</p>

<p>The French were going to follow up their success
of August twentieth with another attack which
would take place “’most any day” and then we
would be sent back for rest. The centre of this attack
was to take place in front of Fort Douaumont,
and, if anything, it would be harder on us
than when we were at Haudremont on the twentieth.</p>

<p>The attack took place on the seventh of September
and while some ground was gained, the success
was not as decisive as the previous attack.</p>

<p>But the relief did not come for us, we were to
stay on, “just for two or three days longer,” through
the counter attack of the Germans.</p>

<p>Personally I was playing out very rapidly. I
was losing the ability to relax and recuperate when
off duty. I was losing the ability to sleep&mdash;I was
reaching the stage of premonitions. I hoped that
I might last out until relief came. I wanted to
finish decently. I was afraid of myself&mdash;I was
afraid I might turn coward&mdash;I was afraid I might
turn quitter.</p>

<p>Then came a drive that I shall always remember.
It was during the counter attack of the Germans.
I shall always remember it, for one reason, because
I was almost tempted to turn coward and quit.</p>

<p>The wounded were coming in fast at Douaumont,
both French and German, and all of our cars were
on duty&mdash;at least all that were able to run. It was
just about noon when I started, and the sun was
shining cheerfully enough overhead but it was hell
on earth. A short distance out I passed one of the
English cars coming in and the driver shouted to
me to have my gas mask ready. I confess I had a
feeling of fear. I had seen the victims of poison
gas and I had a greater dread of that than I had of
shells, if such a thing were possible, and besides a
couple of nights before during a period that I had
been on constant duty for thirty hours in which time
I had punctured six tires, had had a slight touch of
gas and had felt rather ragged ever since. About
four miles out, I passed one of our cars and the
driver called to me something about big shells and
gas. I stopped to call back for more particulars,
but he was too far back to hear me. I was wavering
but I drove on. A little further and I could see
the shells coming in. I could see the gas clouds. I
stopped my car&mdash;I got out and then I had the hardest
argument I have ever had with myself. First I
argued: “It is suicide to go on, I am justified in
turning back and reporting the road is impassable.”
Then I argued with myself, “But if I do go on and
am hit, the agony will be over with in a few minutes,
but if I turn back, the agony will be with me
the rest of my life.” So I put on my gas mask
and drove on.</p>

<p>Approaching the brow of the hill, I saw three of
our cars drawn up alongside the road. I stopped
my car directly behind them and walked ahead.
The engine of one of the cars was still running, but
the cars were all deserted. At that minute a shell
struck just at the brow of the hill. The stop had
undoubtedly saved me. I ran down an embankment
into a deserted dug-out and there I crouched,
sweltering in my gas mask. A few minuter later I
ran out, jumped into my ambulance, passing the
three deserted cars and drove on, trembling so that
I could scarcely keep my feet on the right pedals.
I reached the post at Douaumont and there in the
entrance was our French Lieutenant Reymond in
his steel helmet, calm and undisturbed, directing
and assisting in the loading of the ambulances. He
quietly and good-naturedly took me to task because
my boots were not properly laced. I gave him a
cigarette and lighted one myself. Then I went inside
the post where tea was being ladled out to the
stretcher bearers. This steadied me a bit. I went
out. The place was littered with wounded, mostly
Germans. Lieutenant Reymond assisted me in
lifting wounded Germans into the car.</p>

<p>Then I drove back and went off duty. Some time
in the middle of the night I had a terrible nightmare
and went through the whole experience over
again, and in it I dreamed that I had an urgent call
to go back to the same post. I woke up, but the
dream had been so vivid that I really thought I had
received a call. I pulled on my boots and, partly
dressed, started for my car. Stevenson and “Red”
Day who were out there informed me there had
been no call and sent me back to bed. Stevenson
gave me a drug to make me sleep. Later, I found
that “Red” Day deliberately fixed my car so it
would not run in the event of my receiving any more
imaginary calls in the night.</p>

<p>It was the day following that, as I was sitting on
the end of my cot about to lie down, a shell struck
outside and a piece of the shell about the size of an
inkwell ripped a hole in the tent and struck on my
pillow. I picked it up while it was still hot, walked
out and showed it to Lieutenant Reymond and we
laughed together over the incident. Lieutenant
Reymond’s laugh was fairly hearty.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of September, after forty-five
days and forty-five nights under shell fire day and
night, we received orders to go on repose. A little
while later Stevenson packed me in his staff car
and started me on my way to Paris to see a doctor.</p>

<p>I was not elated&mdash;I was utterly dejected. I had
wanted to finish strong and I had all but finished
in the discard. “Take a month off or as long as you
need, but I want you to come back,” was Steve’s
kind and cheering parting, as the car pulled down
the road.</p>

<p>The men in the Section had all been wonderful.
Lieutenant Reymond had been magnificent, but I
am sure but for the brainy, watchful, sympathetic
leadership of William Yorke Stevenson, the Section
would never have held together those long days
and nights, in the seething, shrieking, blood-stained
hell in front of Verdun&mdash;“The valley of the shadow
of death.”</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">In Paris</h4>

<p class="p2">On leaving the Section, I was feeling too tired
and dejected to experience any deep regrets that
I would not be with my friends for the celebration
which had been planned upon reaching Bar le Duc.
Also I was feeling a little depressed in starting off
for Paris broke, penniless, not a franc in my pocket.
As a matter of fact I had been in that financial condition
(if such a condition can be called financial)
for nearly two months, because a cablegram which
I had sent to the United States the latter part of
July had not reached its destination. Whether it
had been lost in the ocean or had been confiscated
and hypothecated for what it was worth by the
enemy, I shall never know. Enough to say that I
was broke.</p>

<p>During those long weary days and nights and
weeks, I had not possessed the price of a cigarette
and during that time I had grown to have the firmest
convictions that anyone who is opposed to sending
tobacco to the Allies is either most happily
ignorant of the nerve-racking strain of war or is
out and out pro-German.</p>

<p>Yet I was not allowed to suffer too much, for my
friends in the Section, evidently believing that I
was honest, were very kind to me, so I managed to
have a smoke with a fair degree of regularity. I
borrowed two francs from Stockwell with which I
bought a pipe in which I smoked Ned Townsend’s
“granulated” or even the terrible French tobacco
when I thought that Ned Townsend might feel that
I was imposing on him too much. I was rather
clumsy at rolling cigarettes, but Frank Farnham
was very helpful in that respect. He became so
accustomed to performing this kind service for me
that all I had to do was to look at him and say,
“Farney” and out would come his bag of tobacco.</p>

<p>A few days before leaving the Section, I had
written in to Paris to despatch a second cablegram
to the United States and I hoped upon reaching
Paris I would find the essential reply waiting for
me at the banking house of Morgan-Harjes.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to get into the Staff car to
start for Paris, it was “Farney” who came up to
me and handed me twenty francs to see me through
the journey.</p>

<p>It was midnight when I reached Paris and I was
completely tired out. I engaged a taxicab and told
the chauffeur to drive to Henry’s, Number Eleven,
Rue Volney. Henry’s Hotel had been the semi-official
headquarters of Section One in Paris practically
since the war started. Here at least I could
make myself known.</p>

<p>To be sure, I had some excellent letters to people
in Paris but I certainty was not going to use them
to establish credit, and I did not feel up to social
calls.</p>

<p>Before the war, Henry’s had been something of a
rendezvous for rich sporting men, those who followed
the races and the like. Since the war, it was
still patronized by those who had gone there before
and also by aviators, ambulanciers, army officers,
French, English and American. Henry had a transient
business and he also held a clientèle. When I
had been there in June, I had seen certain well
dressed, well groomed young and middle aged men
drifting in at certain hours. I saw these same faces
there again in September and also saw them again
in December. I wondered what their occupations
might be, either real or ostensible. Almost any day
between five and six, Henry could be seen shaking
dice with his clientèle.</p>

<p>Henry was a little short trim fellow with a florid
face, grey moustache and usually dressed immaculately
in a frock coat. He wore glasses when he
took inventory of the cash register. When he took
inventory of people, he usually squinted his eyes into
little slits, so that people who were being inventoried
would scarcely realize that they were being
noticed. Among foreigners and Parisians, Henry
was one of the characters of the city. I say “was,”
because Henry has since passed on to another
world. When I reached there the hotel was closed
but a ring on the bell brought the concièrge to the
door in his pajamas and bath robe. I was shown
to a room with a bed in it, white pillows, clean sheets&mdash;and
it was very nice.</p>

<p>I was not long in getting to bed and not much
longer in getting to sleep, but in my sleep I was
once more back at Verdun. I could hear the aeroplanes
whirring overhead&mdash;I could hear the bursting
shells&mdash;I could see the dead horses on the
crowded roads, the rats and filth, the desolation of
the front. Not a very peaceful sleep; and when I
awoke I felt somewhat confused as I looked over
toward the windows and saw the heavy curtains
drawn together. A clock was ticking on the mantel.
It was nearly nine o’clock. Beside the bed I
observed a telephone and without raising my head
from the soft, comfortable, clean white pillow, I
reached for it. I might be broke, but at least I was
going to have one good meal to fortify me for the
day. The office answered the call. “Grapefruit,”
I said; “soft boiled eggs, toast with butter on it,
coffee&mdash;and a pack of cigarettes.” I ordered an expensive
brand of cigarettes, as I was afraid it might
hurt my credit to call for cheap ones. Then I closed
my eyes and dozed peacefully.</p>

<p>A little later in the morning, I met Henry. We
sat down on the sofa at the foot of the stairs, and I
told him Ned Townsend, Stevenson and the other
men in the Section had sent him their best regards.
Then I told him I was broke but added quickly
that I expected a cablegram any day&mdash;perhaps to-day.
Henry was very nice and polite about it and
told me not to worry.</p>

<p>When I went out of the hotel, I intended to go
over to the offices of Morgan-Harjes and learn
whether a reply had come to my second cablegram,
but I really did not feel strong enough to stand any
unfavorable news. A hack driver coming along
Rue Volney cracked his whip and I almost fell on
the pavement. My nerves seemed to be temporarily
shattered. I still had a few francs left that “Farney”
had given me, so I called a taxi-cab and drove
to 21 Rue Reynouard, the headquarters of the
American Field Service. Dr. Lines looked me over
and informed me that my heart was in bad condition
and that I needed a complete rest. He suggested
sending me out to a convalescent hospital in
the country, but I did not feel well enough to go to
a hospital&mdash;I did not want to see the inside of a
hospital and&mdash;besides, I was waiting for a cablegram
from the States. Later in the day I pulled
myself together and went down Boulevard Haussmann
to the offices of Morgan-Harjes. About that
place I remembered having written to my partner
in the banking business, that while their furniture
is not as handsome as ours, they seemed to have more
customers.</p>

<p>At Morgan-Harjes there was no news for me.</p>

<p>I went back to Henry’s and retired for the afternoon.
I arose for supper, which I had in the café&mdash;and
signed for it; a short walk as far as the Café
de la Paix, back to Henry’s and to bed, back to
sleep, back to Verdun&mdash;back to the shrieking shells,
the whirr of the aeroplanes, the rats, and the crowded,
bloodstained roads.</p>

<p>Waking the next morning, I reached for the
telephone, breakfasted in bed and dozed until noon,
then walked over to Morgan-Harjes.</p>

<p>No news&mdash;</p>

<p>After a fashion I have learned to study expression
in faces; and on the days immediately following,
when I got out of bed and went to Morgan-Harjes,
I could tell by the expression of the clerk’s
face before he spoke to me that there was no news.
I also noticed by the expression on Henry’s face
that I should begin to worry. He was not wearing
his glasses but he was squinting his eyes.</p>

<p>I spent most of my time in bed. I needed the rest.
The crowds, the boulevards, the early evening café
life, the movies, the Follies&mdash;none of these had any
allurement for me. I think it was on the fifth day
that I ran into my poet friend young Bob Hillyer
of Harvard and South Orange, New Jersey. He
too had been out to the front with an Ambulance
Section and was now on his way back to Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where he was going to accept a professorship
in the university which has made that
town fairly famous.</p>

<p>I was very glad to see Bob Hillyer again in spite
of the fact that he told me I looked perfectly terrible
and should really return to the States and not
think of going back to the front. He asked me to
dinner with himself and a friend of his. I protested,
mildly suggesting that they take dinner
with me at Henry’s, but the stronger will prevailed
and the three of us had dinner together at a little
quiet outdoor café underneath the awnings.</p>

<p>They walked back to Henry’s with me, where my
pride and hospitality got the better of my judgment.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t they come in and have a little cordial
before going along?</p>

<p>Certainly!</p>

<p>We went inside&mdash;the cordials were ordered&mdash;I
laid down three francs.</p>

<p>“Four francs, fifty, Mr. Rice,” said George, who
had come to know me by name from having served
me my breakfast in bed.</p>

<p>I picked up the three francs, put them in my
pocket and said, “Please put it on my bill, George.”
It is really terrible to be apparently well-to-do and
not have any money to do it with.</p>

<p>Hillyer and his friend said “Good-night,” and I
promptly went to bed. It was a little past midnight
I think and I had been fast asleep for some time,
back at Verdun with the bursting shells and scurrying
and scurrilous rats, when I suddenly became
conscious of the fact that a firm hand was resting on
each one of my shoulders. I awoke with a start and
there stood Ned Townsend smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“Get up,” he said. “Don’t you know it is your
turn out to post?” At the foot of the bed stood
“Red” Day. They had just reached Paris and informed
me they had come on from the front to cheer
me up a bit. “Farney” was with them too.</p>

<p>Why say I was glad to see them all? They sat
on the side of the bed and told me about the banquet
at Bar le Duc and Ned told me that “Red”
and “Farney” were slated for the Croix de Guerre,
which was very good news.</p>

<p>Townsend had received the Croix de Guerre a
long time before.</p>

<p>We had late breakfast together and they paid for
it and then I went around to Morgan-Harjes. I
read the expression on the clerk’s face as I stepped
up to the window. When I left, I discovered there
was a spring to my step which had been absent on
the previous days.</p>

<p>I walked rapidly back to Henry’s and into the
hotel. Henry was in the hallway at the foot of the
stairs. As he saw me, I observed the expression on
his face&mdash;he was not wearing his glasses but his eyes
were squinted into little slits. I knew what was
coming as he said he would like to speak to me. I
cheerfully replied: “It is all right, the cablegram
has come.”</p>

<p>When I saw Ned Townsend, “Red” Day and
“Farney,” I told them they were to have supper at
a certain quiet little café of mine, opposite the “Chinese
Umbrella.”</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Aillianville</h4>

<p class="p2">Though my leave had not expired, I decided to
return to the front with Townsend, “Red” Day and
“Farney.” The Section had moved down into Lorraine,
in the foot hills of the Vosges, the land of
Joan of Arc. We found our Section in the town of
Aillianville. There a barn had been converted into
a dining room and up in the loft some of the men
had placed their cots, while others were billeted in
the homes of the townspeople&mdash;plain but wonderfully
kindhearted peasant folks whose dress was in
keeping with the surroundings and who splashed
around the muddy streets in their wooden sabots&mdash;and
the streets were often muddy, for it rained a
great deal of the time. But in spite of frequent
rains it was none the less delightful here. It was a
most pleasant contrast to the desolation in front
of Verdun&mdash;to see unmolested forests, the foliage
turning to autumn colors&mdash;to see cows grazing in
the fields&mdash;sometimes a dog on a frolic, barking at
their heels&mdash;to see peasant women sitting in the
fields with their knitting and keeping a watchful
eye on the cattle&mdash;and the war not so very many
miles away.</p>

<p>Ned Townsend and I lost no time in finding quarters
in the home of a peasant. The house, which
could not have been built later than the seventeenth
century, had two rooms and a garret. One
room with open fire place served as a kitchen, living
room and bedroom all combined. A bed was built
in the wall and during the day was hidden by curtains.
Here slept the patron Tourgant and his
wife. Townsend and I took the other room, which
had two beds in it. One of the window panes was
gone, but this was none the less luxury. Our work
was light and we enjoyed the life to the fullest extent.
We could retire at night with a sense of security
that we were not likely to be disturbed before
morning. The house stood under the shadow
of an ancient church and if we did lie awake, we
could hear the clock in the steeple chiming off the
quarter hours. It was sometimes pleasant to awaken
in the middle of the night to hear the clock striking
the hour and then to fall asleep again with the
thought that there were some hours left for undisturbed
rest.</p>

<p>It was usually Madame Tourgant, with wrinkled
face, bronzed like a gipsy, who called us in the
morning and set a cup of hot coffee by our beds.
Sometimes when we came in late, chilled and wet
with the rain, Monsieur Tourgant would get out of
bed, pull on a few clothes, kick the dying embers of
the faggots on the hearth into life and heat a cup of
coffee for us. And so if there was some work to
do, there was time for rest and relaxation.</p>

<p>In this country, it had once been the sport of
kings to hunt the wild boar. Now the kings were
otherwise engaged, but it was still the sport of peasants
and poilus. Kings do not control all the sport
there is&mdash;especially now.</p>

<p>One night we went out on a wild boar hunt, skirting
the edge of a thick forest, not far from Aillianville
down in the direction of the ancient town of
Grand. Midnight, our hunt being unsuccessful, we
sat down on the ground in the moonlight and enjoyed
the feast which we had brought with us. We
did not have another opportunity to go boar hunting
because of the rains, which caused Ned Townsend&mdash;or
was it “Red” Day?&mdash;to complain that the ground
was too wet to sit on.</p>

<p>But if we had been unsuccessful on our hunt, our
patron M. Tourgant fared better, bringing one in a
couple of days later and the following night we were
invited to sit around the open fireplace while Madame
Tourgant put slices of it to sizzling over the
faggots on the open fireplace. She prepared other
things for the supper too. Some French soldiers
that we knew were with us and I am sure ’most any
king would have relinquished his crown for a night,
to have sat under those old blackened rafters and
enjoyed the sport of ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>Sometimes in Aillianville we would drop into the
little “Cheval Blanc Café” to write letters or sit up
at the open log fireplace with Madame Julie and her
husband the patron and while drying our feet which
were usually wet, read the romances of Alexandre
Dumas and the like; sometimes the butcher maidens
from the neighboring town of Grand would
come driving along with their butcher wagon and
from them we would procure a slice of ham or bacon
which Madame Julie would cook for us with an
omelette. Sometimes in the early evening, we
played dominoes in the “Cheval Blanc” for stakes
which were not ruinous. In the early evening
Madame Julie’s niece Marie might drop in to help
her with the dishes.</p>

<p>Marie was a cripple girl, but she was none the less
the queen of all Aillianville. Her father owned his
own comfortable little home and was the possessor
of more cows than anyone else in the town. Marie’s
cheeks were bronzed from the sun while watching
her father’s cows. Her teeth shone white when she
smiled. She had a noble brow and a regal face.
Given the opportunity of two or three years in a
fashionable finishing school, provided she did not become
too highly educated, Marie could have been
transplanted to Madison Avenue or Rittenhouse
Square and scored a decided hit. I have it from one
who lives not far from Madison Avenue and confirmed
by one who lives not far from Rittenhouse
Square. Marie will probably marry a poilu returning
from the war with one arm and a Croix de
Guerre and live happily ever after in the peaceful
town of Aillianville.</p>

<p>Sometimes sitting by the log fire in the “Cheval
Blanc,” we would hear the clank of wooden sabots
on the stone pavement outside, the door would open
and old Jacques, the blacksmith of rugged voice and
jet black beard, would bluster in for his bottle of
wine.</p>

<p>We lived with the peasants and loved them. They
were kind, polite, chivalrous&mdash;they were real.</p>

<p>On occasion, there was music in the evening in the
“Lion d’Or Café” further down the street. One
night, toward the end of October, we held a dance
in the “Lion d’Or.” A guitar and a mandolin furnished
the music. The villagers came around in
their wooden sabots. French soldiers in their blue
uniforms were there. Back in the shadow of a corner,
a group of officers sat enjoying the scene, no
doubt wishing they might take an active part. In
the course of the evening, a young fellow was lifted
on a table and sang “Madelon,” a song popular with
the French just then.</p>

<p>It was pretty close to midnight when a message
came in that one of our cars had broken down along
the road about ten miles out. A relief party was
organized and the dance came to an end.</p>

<p>It had been snowing in the late afternoon and
evening. When we went out of the Lion d’Or the
moon was breaking through the clouds, and the
streets, tile roofs of the houses and the church
steeples were white with snow.</p>

<p>Not one of us who was not a little sad a few days
later on receiving orders to move from the town of
Aillianville to the ancient town of Beaufromont,
built on the side of a steep hill. We were glad that
the villagers also expressed sorrow at the parting.
Some of those plain peasant women were kind
enough to weep a little as they smilingly waved “Au
’voir” to us.</p>

<p>Our old patron, the boar hunter Tourgant, was
so anxious to bid us a fitting farewell when we
started in the early morning that he stayed up most
of the night. When we moved out of the town he
was asleep in the blacksmith shop of old Jacques of
rugged voice and jet black beard.</p>

<p>As we drew up in line outside the village, someone
commemorated the departure in verse:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Farewell, my Aillianville, in fair Lorraine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Town where sun shines through the rain,</div>
  <div class="i0">The “Cheval Blanc,” the “Lion d’Or,”</div>
  <div class="i0">“Au ’voir,” farewell forever more.</div>
  <div class="i0">I was with you when woods were brown,</div>
  <div class="i0">When boars were hunted on the down,</div>
  <div class="i0">When log fire crackled on the hearth</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the evening there was mirth</div>
  <div class="i0">And music in the town I love so well,</div>
  <div class="i0">Oh, Aillianville, au ’voir, farewell.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>During our stay in Aillianville, Section One,
American Field Service Volunteers, was taken over
by the American army and there ceased to be any
volunteer ambulance service. My work was done,
but the Section being short of men I agreed to stay
on indefinitely until new men came on.</p>

<p>One day, to be exact, Thanksgiving morning, outside
the town of Neufchateau, on the road to Nancy,
I saw some French troops drawn up on review. A
band was playing at their head. By a strange coincidence
I had heard that same band playing once
before back in Houdainville as those same troops
were advancing for the big offensive in front of
Verdun.</p>

<p>On this Thanksgiving morning, the review being
over, the men stacked arms and walked about the
field. One of the soldiers walked over to where I
was talking with some friends. He wore a steel
helmet, but underneath the visor I could see a scar
across his forehead and there was a scar on his cheek.
He asked me if I remembered him and I was obliged
to confess that I did not. He then informed me
that on September second, in front of Douaumont,
when he had received these two scars, I had carried
him back. No wonder I had not recognized him.</p>

</div>

<p>Then as we stood there I heard another band
playing in the distance. It grew nearer and nearer
till at last I saw an American flag rising over the
brow of the hill and back of it swinging along the
road four thousand men in khaki.</p>

<p>I confess I felt a thrill!</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Vive l’Amérique! Vive la France!</h4>

<p class="p2">The delightful days at Aillianville will always
stand out in my memory in marked contrast with
the forty-five days and forty-five long nights that
we spent before Verdun. I shall always remember
a night in a dug-out in front of Verdun toward the
end of our long siege. The place was dimly lighted.
At one end was a table on which there was a telephone.
A French officer sat there writing reports
and answering telephone calls. “’Allo! ’Allo!” he
would say, taking down the receiver. Along the
wall was a wooden bench on which sat two weary
poilus, their heads nodding under their steel helmets.
On the floor, a wounded soldier lay on a
stretcher. Outside I could hear the firing of the
guns, the trampling of horses, the straining and
groaning of the heavy munition trucks pulling up
the grade.</p>

<p>I was very tired, in fact I had reached the stage
of premonitions. I felt that luck had been with me
just as long as might be expected and in the fagged,
depressed condition of my brain I felt quite certain
that my next time out would be my last. I have
seen others pass through the same stage when they
have been worn out. I suppose Alan Seeger must
have felt like that when he wrote his wonderful
poem “I have a rendezvous with Death.”</p>

<p>As I sat there waiting for my turn to go out and
expecting a call each time the telephone rang, I
got to thinking of my early impressions upon reaching
France. It seemed a long time since I had
landed in France. Then I got to thinking of my
later impressions after coming to the Front. To
keep my mind from dwelling on what was happening
outside, where I must soon go, I took some
scraps of paper and wrote a brief summary of my
impressions, supposing that it might be the last
words I would write. I had just finished writing
when the telephone rang. The officer took down
the receiver, “’Allo! ’Allo! San Fein!” The officer
turned to me. It was my turn out. I put the
scraps of paper in my pocket, slipped into my heavy
coat, put on my steel helmet, shook hands with the
officer and went out.</p>

<p>It was a short run but a bad one, shells were arriving
and shells were departing. I found an Abri
had been squarely hit and badly torn up. I got
four wounded, who were in very bad condition. I
drove back and got through. My premonitions
were not realized. It was sunrise when I drove
away from the hospital and my work for the night
was over. Coming down the road I met Holt. He
told me he was having trouble with his car and he
asked me to wait while he made some repair. I
drew up alongside the road, put my head down on
the steering wheel and went to sleep. A few minutes
later Holt woke me up and we drove on together.
A short while later, over hot coffee, I confessed
to Holt the premonitions I had the night before.
And then he confessed that he had had them,
too. Then I read to him what I had written:</p>

<p>“I gained my first impression of France while
sailing up the broad Gironde River, flanked by its
stately trees, its green and rolling fields, its Catholic
spires, its old châteaux and ancient monasteries.
I came on to Paris. I saw and admired that magnificent
city which stoically smiles through sorrow. I
stood at the tomb of Napoleon but I did not shed a
tear; I sat in Nôtre Dame Cathedral on a Sabbath
afternoon, and there I saw women with faces sad
but brave, kneeling in prayer; I heard the organ’s
sacred notes; perhaps I shed a tear, why should I
say? I sat at one of the many crowded tables in
front of the famous Café de la Paix and there I
watched the Congress of the Armies of the Allied
Nations, sipping drinks, smoking cigarettes, passing
the time of day. I drove up the sloping, tree lined
Champs Elysées at sunset and through the Arch
of Triumph. At its crest I saw the tinted sky
and clouds and tops of trees and as I drove on
through the peaceful groves of the Bois du Boulogne
by moonlight I thought that though I loved
my native land I would love to live in France.</p>

<p>“Then I came on out to the battle front. I passed
through desolate villages, past desecrated cathedrals;
I saw deserted homes and shell wrecked
towns. I heard the thunder and roar of many guns,
I heard the crash of avion bombs, I heard the shriek,
the whistle, the moan of shells. I saw the horror
and havoc that these things wrought, the wounded,
the dying, the countless dead. But through all the
terrors of the days and nights I saw the noble Nation,
fatigued, yet with Christlike resignation suffering
and bleeding so that others might live to enjoy
an honorable repose. And I thought that the prayer
of this noble Nation must be the prayer of Christ:
‘O Lord, forgive them, for they know not what
they do!’ And as I saw these things I thought that
though I loved my Country, the land of Chance,
though I loved my own Flag, I should be willing to
die for France, but it has not thus far been willed
and I am glad. I am glad to go on living and loving
France. She is our kin. Her blood is on our
soil, our blood on hers. She is our sister country.</p>

<h4 class="p2 h4head">Afterthoughts</h4>

<p class="p2">So now my story is told and as I close the pages
of the book I pause to think and wonder if ever
again I shall see France. I wonder if again I shall
walk along the quays of the River Seine or up the
sloping tree-lined Champs Elysées, or wander with
friends around to the Café de la Paix, or if again I
shall pass through the desolate villages at the front
and hear the shrieking shells, the aeroplanes overhead
singing in the night “Guerre, guerre, guerre,”
their monotonous song of death. I wonder if again
I shall see those noble, weary people of our Sister
Country fighting bravely against the Iron Hand;
whether I shall go back to see our own flag being
carried on to final victory; and rejoice that America
at last has ridden into the field full armed, the
Savior of France, as was once the Maid of Orleans.</p>

<p>I wonder if I shall resist or follow that invisible
finger beckoning to me&mdash;whether I shall listen to
that voice whispering and saying to me, “Come
back”?</p>

<p>I wonder if again I shall see the towers of Rheims
Cathedral or stand upon the hill beside the resting
place of Norton?</p>

<p>I wonder if again some day I shall walk into the
peaceful town of Aillianville and sit down by the
crackling fire and visit my friend Tourgant, the
boar hunter, and his wife; whether I shall some
evening step in the “Cheval Blanc” and to Madame
Julie and the patron, say, as I have said before:
“Bon soir, Madame, bon soir, Monsieur”; whether
sometime I shall sit with Marie and her husband,
who will wear the Croix de Guerre upon his breast,
and with them talk about the war. I wonder if I
shall again go in the “Lion d’Or,” and, in happy
memory, hear the music as I did before, and if perhaps
I shall see again my friends of Section One
in France?</p>

<p>I wonder if I shall answer that voice which
whispers to me as I walk along the crowded streets,
which whispers as I lie awake at night, which whispers
in my sleep and says to me&mdash;“Come back.”</p>
